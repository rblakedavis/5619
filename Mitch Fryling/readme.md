# Part 1


OK, so thank you for coming
to listen to me talk,

and for inviting me
to this conference.

[INAUDIBLE] introductions.

It is true I am sort of a
conceptual theory philosophy

junkie, even if I
don't want to be.

I just keep finding
myself talking

about conceptual issues, so
I guess I really like them.

As the university
would say, I keep

doing what I'm
reinforced to doing.

And I thought a lot
about this conference

and what I would
talk to you about,

realizing that many of you
probably work with children

of autism spectrum disorder.

I don't want to bore you
with some, I don't know,

nuances of things that I think
are really important while I

stare out my office window.


I teach applied
behavioral courses,

and I've become increasingly
passionate about talking

to practitioners, in particular,
about why theory and philosophy

might matter to
you, and why I think

it's important for practitioners
to have some exposure to theory

and philosophy.

And try to more than
just tell you that,

but show you how it relates
to the work that you do.

So anyway, that's my--

I don't know if it's is
a warning or a rationale.

OK, so I'm very inspired by the
work that behavior analysts do.

I think about what
behavior analysts do a lot.

I think a lot about what
students do that work with me.

I've thought a lot
about what you all do.

We all have a huge
opportunity to improve

the lives of the people
that we work with,

and I think it's a very
serious job that we all do.

So I went to school at
Western Michigan University.

And if you are at all
familiar with Western Michigan

University, you know
that you're sort of

forced to become exposed to
behavior analysis, if you

take any sort of
psychology course there.

And I completely fell
in love with the ideas

of behavioral
analysis, and I think

that influences a lot of how we
look at problems in the world.

We don't think problems
are inside of people.

Many behavioral analysts
have heard of victim blaming.

So we don't blame the victim.

In this case, the victim would
be of a poor environment.

And we assume that
behavior occurs

and is influenced by the
context in which it happens.

So you have to understand
the context of behavior

if you want to
understand behavior.

So I hope that, when we
talk about those two things,

specifically-- and those are
just two assumptions that

I'm going to talk about today,
the victim blaming issue,

don't blame the victim, and
really examine the context--

that these aren't just things
that behavior analysts say,

but they're really
things that are

a part of every single
thing that you do.

So you really have to
understand these ideas,

and if they're going
to influence your work,

you probably have
to have a continued

exposure to these
ideas, and really

talk about them regularly.


The thing is, as
many of you know,

and as we were
reminded when we were

talking about fad treatments,
these ideas are not normal.

They're normal for us, and
they make a lot of sense,

but I guess literally, in
the technical way of defining

normalcy, most
people don't think

how behavioral analysts think.

Most people do
think that behavior

is driven by something that can
never be found inside of you.

So it's not surprising
that those same people

develop a bunch of
zany ideas to try

to create behavior problems.

So at the core of
all this, there

is a difference, as far as
how we think about behavior.

And we live in the same world as
those zany ideas, which causes

a whole bunch of problems.

It makes our lives
very stressful.

We're trying to do
something helpful.

We have to figure out how to
interact with these people.

We were talking about this
at lunch a little bit.

It's very difficult. We're
also at risk, though,

being behavioral analysts
who are living in that world,

for falling into some
of those same footsteps.

And if you were to look at
the data, I was thinking,

for the BCBAs who may
also be practicing

non-behavior, non
evidence-based practices,

I can't help but think
that those may have

been slipping off the wagon.

It's like, folks who got on the
bandwagon in graduate school,

you fell off.

Maybe you never got on
properly in the first place.

So I see this all
the time, this sort

of quasi-behavioral person, who
was once maybe a behaviorist,

but isn't very much a
behaviorist these days.

And I can't help but think
that the world has just

influenced them.

And this would make
sense, given how

we are influenced
by our surroundings,

and I don't think anybody
is entirely immune to this.

So I think that,
at the same time,

I'm telling you how
important this issue is.

At the same time, I
think that probably--

and I'm not saying
this quite as boldly

as I might to other audiences--

theory is underemphasized in
applied behavioral analytical

training programs, and
professional development,

and more.

I've even had people tell
me that it completely

doesn't matter.

And it's oftentimes seen
that theory and philosophy

are completely
distinct from practice.

I've wondered, and
I've gone to plenty

of theoretical talks in my
day, maybe theoretical folks

aren't very good at talking
to behavior analysts who

work with people who
are making differences

in the lives of the kids and
adults and everyone every day.

And it could be that
that's the case.

But I just keep thinking, and
as I talked myself into talking,

if this is what keeps us
from being mentalists,

some of these ideas, from
collapsing into all that,

and from helping
people the best we can

and from avoiding victim blaming
and from examining the context

more thoroughly, and goodness.

I don't know, it
might be my bias,

but I think we should
talk about it more.

So that's why I'm here, talking
to you about this topic,

in particular.

It just keeps coming up
in my life, in my work,

and I can't think of a
better way for me to--

something for me to talk
about to this audience.

So this is what I'm
hoping to do today.

I'm going to talk about
behavioral contingencies

and context-- by the way,
sorry this font is so small,

I didn't realize the
setup ahead of time--

talk about some implications
of this distinction

between contingencies
and context

for practice, for
research, and then I'll

finish revisiting some
of our assumptions

about why behavior occurs,
and tying this in altogether.

So most of you are probably
familiar with the term

contingency.

I always say most,
because I do realize

some behavioral analysts,
actually, in my experience,

don't define this
term properly, to me.

But that's perfectly fine.

We're all figuring
things out together.

But you know, for
example, that reinforcers

should be delivered contingent
on a behavior, right?

And we assume that contingencies
influence challenging behavior.

And if you were to ever take
a course in the functional

behavioral analysis and behavior
of functional assessment,

you know that a
lot of that is all

about the manipulation of,
you've got it, contingencies.

We've got to know something
about contingencies if we're

behavioral analysts, right?

This is really at the
core of what we do.

Contingencies
emphasize consequences.

So of course, if you
wanted to be technical,

and I'm all about being
technical, and to see

stimuli do matter.

We talk about
discriminative stimuli.

So I have Sds there, and
Sds also are important.

They occasion behavior
because of their relationship

to consequences, though.

It is important that
that is emphasized.

What about MOs?

Other antecedent
variables that we love

to talk about, very important.

They alter the value
of consequences

and increased behavior
that has been reinforced

by those consequences.

So this shouldn't be
surprising to all of us,

because that's what we all do.

This is how we improve
behavior that we work on

on a daily basis, as
consistent with Skinner's more

general offering to
approach, to understanding

why people behave.

So I think this idea
has been very helpful.

It certainly shifted focus
away from the individual.

So early on I said one
of my favorite ideas

about the behavior
analysis idea is totally

that keeps me falling in
love with behavioral analysis

is that we don't blame
people for their behavior.

So a contingency is a great
construct, a great concept,

that turns away
from the individual,

and towards the context.

So the contingency
has been very helpful,

in large part, because
it has shifted away focus

from something that doesn't
exist inside the individual

and towards some
part of the context.

And like I said, it adds to
understanding the environment.

So they've done
more than that, too.

The contingency has
helped us focus.

And I'm amazed--

I read, and re-read, and
re-read things as I prepare

for classes--

and look no further than very
detailed, well-designed skill

acquisition programs
for learners.

It's amazing, some of the stuff
that behavioral analysts do.

And step by step by step
by step, consideration

of all of the sequence of
skills and reinforcing this

before that, and then this.

I mean, it's enough
to make you dizzy.

It's very, very, very well-done.

And the contingency
is what helped

people focus like
that, that we just

can't sort of wing it when
we're teaching people things.

We have to deliberately
focus on specific skills.

And then, of course,
look no further, again,

than the functional
analysis model

of examining
challenging behavior.

The contingency has
been very helpful.

I mean, if you look
around towards articles

that talk about the reduction
in the use of punishment,

less likely to have all
sorts of right adversive

procedures used, if you
have a functional behavioral

assessment done.

That is all the
contingency right there,

turning away from the individual
and towards the context.

So I think these are
a really big deal.


So it's not surprising,
and I've already

used the word contingency more
than I would on a daily basis,

but contigencies are at
the center of everything

that we do in
behavioral analysis.

And some people would even
say that the contingency

is the subject matter
of our science.

We study contingencies.

And I remember--

I was thinking, when I was
making this presentation--

when I really got it, the
whole contingency thing.

Like, finally, I was
like, oh my gosh,

this behavior's occurring
because it's being reinforced.

Of course.

Oh my gosh, that behavior's
being reinforced, too.

Wow, it's all being reinforced.

And as a professor,
when my students

start thinking like
that, I'm like, good.

You're getting the
contingency, and you're

getting this core issue that's
done a lot of good in society.

So you hear things
like, if it's happening,

there must be a reinforcer,
and I think that's a good sign.

As an audience member
of those statements,

I'm always happy when people
say those sort of things.

But I wonder if contingencies
aren't things that we study.

A contingency is a description
of a pattern that we observe.

A contingency is a
term, and philosophers

use the word construct.

I think it turns
people off when I start

talking like this a little bit.

I don't want to get into the
business of doing something

that many have done,
that is confusing

what we're interested in
with how talk about things.

I mean, we are
interested in behavior.

So we want to be
careful here not

to confuse our descriptions
of what we study,

that being contingencies,
with our subject matter

more generally.

And I think this can
cause some misguidance.

I think it can confuse us
a little bit in practice.

I'm going to get to
practice things in a second.

If you're already
lost because I'm

boring you with
conceptual stuff,

just give me five minutes.

So we're interested in
studying behavioral environment

functional relations,
interactions.

I am slightly obsessed with
interbehaviorism, I suppose.

And that's one of the things
I like about interbehaviorism,

is the very word
interbehavior places

emphasis on this
interaction, that it's not

just behavior
occurring over there,

it's behavior that's
occurring in a context.

And I love the
context, as you'll soon

hear me talking about this.

So added to this,
though, we're interested

in these interactions.

That's what our
subject matter is.

These interactions don't
exist by themselves.

They exist in a context.

And interbehaviorists
like to use the word feel.

That's neither here
nor there to me.

But contingencies, for example,
are part of the situation.

They aren't the thing
that you're working in.

So the context is
much more broad, then,

than the concept
of a contingency,

and it refers to the
full range of factors

that influence behavior,
including and situational

factors.

And the context, then, is really
about the richness of behavior.

And this is another one of my
favorite parts of behavior.

It's complicated.

There are a lot of
things going on.

I'm just not talking up
here because you're all

looking at me.

There's no looking
at me reinforcer.

I have a whole history.

I drove here.

I slept.

I ate.

I got some coffee.

I leave the lights are on.

My computer's working.

There's a lot going on.

Behavior is complex, and
the context highlights that.
# PART 2


So most people
probably agree with me

when I say this sort of thing.

But I don't know that the
role of the contingency,

and it being at the forefront
of everything that we do,

that we talk about, the
implications of that.

So we sometimes even
search for particular types

of contingencies
and reinforcers.

And this is one of
the times that I

don't smile when I hear students
saying this kind of thing.

So you hear behavioral
analysts say, oh, you know,

the four functions.

Or I discovered a
fifth, I heard a rumor.

Some of you guys told me that.

I heard a rumor, there's
a fifth function,

as though functions exist
somewhere off in space

and we might find
another one someday.

Functions are relations.

They are things
that behavior has.


So I just hope that
way of speaking,

which I'm sure many
of you have heard,

and maybe you have said
it yourself at some point,

is a consequence of getting
a little confused here,

of what contingencies
are, what procedures are,

in particular this case,
and probably overly

following a standardized
ritual of sequential analysis

procedure.

But it puts us at risk for
overlooking the context,

these ways of speaking.

If you speak about contingencies
in such a strict way,

or at the outset, you might
miss the heart of the situation.

And I think at best you
might only get a part of it.

So here's a little diagram.

I know you probably don't like
that I have so many words,

so I tried to put pictures.

I'm horrible at making pictures.

But there is a
contingency there,

for those of you who
like visual things.

And those are the three boxes.

You can put in a, b, c
in them, if you'd like.

But trying to just visually
display that, the context would

be the blue thing behind it,
that there is this contingency,

indeed, but there
is a whole situation

that that contingency
is occurring in.

And honestly, those of you
who work in the field, that's

the situation you work in.

You don't work in contingencies.

You work in people's homes
that are complicated.

They are messy.

Someone just got in a fight.

Someone's sick.

They're late.

It's never those boxes.

But it's amazing,
at the same time,

how useful those boxes are.

[INAUDIBLE]

So anyway, if you focus on the
contingency from the outset,

these are things you
can find yourself

on the cusp of saying,
probably at this point and not

the context.

You might overlook
things, and those things

could be pretty important.

I just want to make sure we're
on board, as far as where

I'm at so far.

So I hope you can tell I'm
slightly paranoid about this.

I hope I don't sound like a
bunch of theoretical babble

to you.

And I hope that this doesn't
seem completely irrelevant,

but I'm going to give
you some applied examples

and show situations where I've
been supervising students who

are working on the supervision
of BCBAs, where I've thought,

gosh, someone is overly thinking
about contingencies, and not

enough about the
context, and I think

they'll stand out to
you in these issues.

OK, so Mitch is a very
interesting client

that you're working with.

He engages in challenging
behavior, not me.

You're a good behavior
analyst, and you do an FBA.

You do an indirect assessment.

Maybe you do several of them, if
you like indirect assessments.

You conduct observations,
and you even

conduct a functional analysis.

So you're a very cool
behavior analyst.

You do the conditions
and everything,

and manipulate the
[INAUDIBLE] and whatnot,

a very detailed procedure.

I'm not reminding you at all.

I'm not.

But you determine that
Mitch's challenging behavior

is maintained by
attention, especially

the nanny's attention.

By the way, this
could be an LA thing.

I hear this a lot.


[INAUDIBLE] talk
about nannies all day.

So as a behavioral
analyst, though, I

bet you have some good ideas.

So you probably think about
functional and communication

training.

You might teach Mitch
to ask for attention

in an appropriate way.

You might also
recommend extinction.

You could withhold
the attention when

Mitch engages in the
challenging behavior,

and maybe you might
also think about

non-contingent reinforcement.

Maybe you should give
Mitch some attention

when he's not engaging
in the problem behavior.

Now, of course,
these interventions

interact with each
other in detailed ways

that I'm not talking
about right now, as far as

teaching someone to
request attention,

and while at the same
time, giving them

contingent attention.

That could be a problem,
but anyway, not the problem

I'm talking about today.

But you can see this common
function-based intervention.


And I love the whole,
you do an assessment.

It tells you what
it is, and then

you just do something
completely related.

It's all connected.

By the way, it is
difficult enough

to get this sort of thing
happening, in my experience,

to make sure
there's a continuity

between the assessment
and the intervention.

So I think this
will probably result

in the behavior decreasing.

But I wonder if your
goal is really just

to get the behavior to decrease.

So we know that
behavior can decrease

for a variety of
reasons, including

medication and
punishment, some of which

could include band-aid
type interventions.

I knew that Dr. [INAUDIBLE]
was going to be here today.

I think I got that idea from
some chapter that he wrote.

Couldn't find it.

I love that idea, though.

I love the idea that we
love effects in behavior.

And so if we see a behavior
go down, we think we got it.

And I guess, in some
ways, that's good.

We want to have some
kind of an effect.

But this band-aid idea being
like, you didn't really get it.

And you're going to
have to always have that

there, because they
could always come

right back if the
intervention were missing.

Great idea.

So you find an
attention function

and you find a
contingency, but you

have to remember
that contingencies

are part of a context.

So think about Mitch and his
attention from his nanny.

What if Mitch has a
pretty boring life?

Or maybe there's a general
lack of stimulation.

What about Mitch's friends?

Does he have any?

At this point, I don't
like this example

It seems kind of
personal of something.

It was too late for
me to switch it.

I was like, OK.

Maybe Mitch doesn't need
functional communication

training, though, like
extinction, or even NCR.

Maybe he needs to learn how to
make friends and get a life.

Now, I don't mean
that in a bad way,

but that's part of all of
us developing as people,

learning how to contact
reinforcers that

are in our environment, not
just how to request reinforcers,

in this case, from the nanny.

So you can think of social
skills and community

involvement as function-based
intervention for Mitch,

in this situation, which seems
a little out of, I think,

the ballpark of what
behavior analysts typically

talk about when they talk about
treating challenging behavior.

But if you think about
this particular person,

I can't help but think a
function-based intervention

involves helping Mitch get some
things going in the real world

that Mitch lives in.


So I'll be a little
faster with Mitch2.0 here,

but I like some examples
of highlighting this.

He throws objects at school.

He's naughty.

You determine through
your, again, behavior

analytic skills, that his
naughty behavior is maintained

by escape.

You've even done
several analyzes

to confirm that this
is the function.

So you've ran out a bunch
of really detailed things,

and it's definitely that,
at the end of the day.

So again, you probably
recommend things, as I think

is a good sign.

Functional
communication training,

teach me to request
a break, give me

some non-contingent breaks.

Maybe if you're ambitious, you
might use extinction therapy.

You might get a
burst, I don't know.

But the behavior goes down.

So you see an effect,
though, again.

But again, I want you
to think of the context.

So as soon as I hear about an
escape maintained behavior,

anytime a student tells me
about this, I always say,

why is the context aversive?

I would not jump to using
an extinction procedure,

or break card, or any of
that stuff that is just

run-of-the-mill applied
behavior analysis.

Think, what is going on?

Why is that situation aversive?

So has a detailed
skills assessment

been conducted,
just for example?

As many of you know, kids go
through school grade by grade.

I'm shocked that there isn't
more challenging behavior

related to academic demands,
because academic demands don't

seem to be individualized.

So it would make sense
for a challenging behavior

to develop if you ask
me to do something

that I'm not prepared to do.

Simple idea, usually not a
part of a common vernacular.

Maybe an intervention
would be tutoring.

In your behavior plan,
you include tutoring,

that there are some academic
skills development that

needs to happen before you even
deal with this behavior problem

at all.

This is a situation that
there's academic skills deficit.

Or maybe you should reconsider
the component skills

for what's happening.

Great skill set for the
behavior analyst to develop.

Or maybe somebody
makes fun of Mitch

in only one of the classes.

So maybe somebody makes fun
of this hypothetical client,

but it's only in math.

And sooner or later,
Mitch has a math label

that he'd behind in
math or something.

He has remedial
services in math,

and it's all because
someone's teasing him in math.

Or maybe someone teased
him in math two years ago

and he fell behind and
nobody really caught him up.

So I just want you
to think, though,

with these two examples here
so far, that maybe absentee

and escape extension, and all
of that other stuff, very,

very, very, good interventions
that do great things,

don't really get at the issue
for this particular person.


OK, the last little example I
want to show you is another,

it's a briefer one.

But You another thing I
think about the context

when I think about
parents, not surprisingly.

But I think of parent training,
and what I've called--

I wrote a paper about
this awhile ago,

where I talked about the
train and train more model

of behavior analysts.

So training them, training
them, they don't get it.

Train them more.

They just don't get it.

They refuse to comply.

So if this happens
for a long time,

and you've done good
behavior analytic training,

as I hope you learn to do
in your graduate training

programs, then I wonder if there
is something about the context.

It's not that they need more
training, it's something else.

So one obvious factor that some
of you probably have noticed

is the amount of stress
that some parents

of children with disabilities
face in their day-to-day lives.

Parents, in general,
have a lot of stress.

If you have a child
with disability,

there's even more chances that
you have a very stressful life.

There's a lot going on,
a lot to think about.

So add to that situation
a behavior consultant

repeatedly asking you
to role play something

again, because you did
not meet some criteria

or something, which is all good
to have as good [INAUDIBLE]

But you should think
about the context there.

What is the real issue?

So you can't help
but think, gosh,

maybe this individual's team,
that you're working with,

should think about
a respite program.

Maybe the family is
exhausted, and they

need to have a
weekend to take a nap,

go shopping, or do anything
that anybody needs to do.

So it could be that if
you recommended something

like that, or you
worked with a team

to have something
like that happen,

you might get at the actual
issue of what's happening.

So anyway, each
of these examples

highlight how a narrow focus
on the contingencies alone,

without thinking
of the context, may

be to a less ineffective
intervention plan.

Just some quick examples.

I hear these examples
all day long.

I thought, gosh, maybe I
should start to make a list.

But it's important to
remember that contingencies,

while they're exceptionally
useful constructs,

they are at the heart of
everything that we do.

And they should be.

You should not confuse them
with the broader situation

that you're working in.

So you need to
examine contingencies.

You need to think
about contingencies,

but don't close your eyes
to the rest of the situation

that you're working in.
# PART 3


So I have a little PR note
for us here as a field.

I want us to notice
how a conceptual issue,

like the definition of the
subject matter of behavior

analysis, has such large
implications for how

we go about solving
problems in the real world.

So I wonder, and I know that
this question sort of lingers

over a lot of practitioners,
does theoretical mumbo

jumbo matter?

I don't know what theoretical
mumbo jumbo does or doesn't.

Maybe it does now,
but gosh, it seems

that some of it, well,
that's my opinion here,

the resounding yes seems
to slap me across the face

almost every day.

Theoretical issues are super
important to everything

that you do.

It's a very difficult job
that behavior analysts have,

and I can help but think
who they could execute

that job really well over time
without constantly revisiting

some of these conceptual issues.

I'll try to fly through this
remaining section more quickly.

So this whole context
thing, hopefully, I've

sort of sold you a little bit
about the context in practice.

This whole context
thing has a lot

of implications for how you
understand research as well,

and I oftentimes
hear practitioners

talk about research as, no, it
doesn't really get at kind of--

I don't know.

It just doesn't seem to
work where I am, right?

You read that article, but now I
have to go to somebody's house,

right?

That was very--
you know, there's

this thing there that's clear.

I have felt that, right?

I was a student, and
I memorized articles,

and then I went to classrooms
where there were things

flying all over the room.

So I think that how
you look at research

can be helped by thinking of
the context in which research

was conducted.

And more over, for those of
you that are researchers,

I think that better
research questions,

or continued research
questions could be developed

by thinking about the context.

So most of my experience
with research, by the way,

has been with graduate students.

I like working with
students myself,

but while it's all
been interesting,

and I've slowly developed
a research repertoire,

it's got a lot of work to do.

There are some
things that stand out

to me when I do research
studies with students.

Some questions.

So I wonder why do
things work with me

and my students when they don't
in the research literature?

And why don't
things work with us

when they do in the
research literature.

I just constantly had these
questions as a gradate student,

and I continue to have
them as a professor.

Here's a thing, it works.

Tried it, flatline.


Love that study, right?

Spent a lot of time
[INAUDIBLE],, flatline.


You know, one thing
that I've worked on,

and I'm not talking about
picky eating as a topic,

but one thing that I've worked
on with graduate students just

as a topic that they
were interested in,

and we've sort of developed
some studies in this area,

is picky eating.

As many of you know
that work with children

with autism spectrum
disorder, picky eating

is a very common topic.

You're probably likely
to confront this topic

at some point in your
professional career.

I hope that you do so in an
interdisciplinary fashion,

and you really rule out any
other sort of complication

that contribute to this.

I'm less talking about
picky eating as a topic,

and more about an example of
the research kind of story.

So much of the
research in this area

has been conducted in
clinic-based settings.

If you've ever delved into
that research literature,

you'll notice that it has.

It's very good
literature, by the way.

I love the feeding literature.

It's very interesting, very
systematic, very well done.

One thing that you'll
see over and over

is the finding that extinction
seems to be required.

So basically, that you need
to extinguish the escape

or avoidance
procedure, and that's

very helpful towards
improving acceptance

and consumption of food.

If you look at the basic
contingency analysis here,

you've got non-preferred food.

The child says no, does
something else inappropriate,

and then there's no
non-preferred food.

Hey, [INAUDIBLE], right?

So it's good news in that we
have this finding that we can

disrupt these contingencies.

But it's difficult to implement
extinction procedures,

especially escape
extinction procedures.

There can be a number
of side effects.

Goodness, if any
of you have ever

thought about
treatment integrity,

it's enough to make you almost
never recommend extinction,

because if you give
in occasionally,

you make it worse.

So I always think of times
where I told parents,

can you do this
almost perfectly?

[INAUDIBLE]


It could be dangerous
if you're not careful.

So I've completely avoided
this topic as far as something

that I dare to actually attempt
to use with graduate students.

So I have kind of dabbled
around in examining

antecedent interventions.

But antecedent
interventions are just

the sort of interventions
that are shown to not work.

So it's interesting to me
because in my experience

they oftentimes do.

So I wonder sometimes they do
work, sometimes they don't.

Here we are.

there's mixed evidence
on this particular topic

as an example of an issue in
the research literature, so

where do you go from there?

Where do you go when sometimes
something works and sometimes

it doesn't.

The high P sequence is a
great example this, right?

There are a bunch of examples
of this behavioral momentum

idea working.

I can't tell you how often
I can remember sitting

in a chair working with a kid.

High-five.

What's your name?

What's your name?

Now do this.

No.

[INAUDIBLE]

I read it.

I was a good [INAUDIBLE],,
developed a protocol, flatline.


Sometimes that procedure
works very well.

Many of you probably
know that too.

So it is just
interesting when you're

in these situations, what do
you do when it works sometimes,

and it doesn't other times?

What do you know what
to do in a situation?

As a practitioner of work
with people in the world,

what do you do?

So I think, like I
often think, you end up

having to think about
the subject matter.

What are you actually studying?

What are you interested in?

Not surprisingly, when I
think of these two questions

that I mentioned
earlier, I think

that we have to end up
going back to the content.

So if you really want
to answer questions

about why behavior occurs
in specific contexts,

you've got to know more
about the specific context.

So some of the things
that I've thought

about while I've looked at the
research literature-- well,

give me a second.

This is just to make
sure I didn't lose you.

So we're all good on don't
place too much emphasis

on consequences.

I mean, consequences are great.

Contingencies are great.

They're very,
very, very helpful.

Careful, remember,
behavior occurs

in a very complicated context.

One that you all probably
know a lot more about that I

do frankly.

Much better though,
even if you were

to focus on contingencies
and not anything else,

you'd be doing better
than mentalists.

At least your focusing on
something in the environment.

You're turning away from
all that victim blame.

So if you're going
to follow something.

People love to follow
rules and protocols

and that sort of thing.

If you're going
to do that, follow

one that's based on
contingencies lest you possible

go mentalistic.


But when I think about
understanding research

and it relates to improving the
lives of people in community

settings or in complex
situations, when

I look at research articles,
I look at them more and more

differently over time.

I ask students to do so too.

But one thing that
has really come up,

and again, this
one in particular

comes out of me
knowing a lot of people

who work in the field, that
work in agencies, own agencies.

There's a therapist
client relationship thing

that is pretty amazing that
behavior analysts don't

talk about more.

And I can't help but think that
sometimes when a study works,

I'm like, who was
that therapist?

You said praise was
provided, how did that look?

We're they really like good?

I mean, anybody that supervises
services knows that there's

a good therapist effect.

I've heard people say I could
ask so and so to do anything,

and it would work.

Well, gosh, then maybe it's
not so much about that thing

that they're doing, it's
about that person's behavior.

How are they implementing
that intervention?

What do they do
that is so special?

What's their history with
the kids that they work with?

So this good therapist effect I
think is a really [INAUDIBLE]..

Honestly, as someone who's
supervised a bunch of studies

over the years at this
point, I can't help

but think sometimes when
it doesn't work, OK,

you're following the protocol
to a T, but you're not really--


you're not doing it, you know?

And other times, it's like you
follow the protocol to a T,

and it totally works.

Wow.

But maybe it's not
the protocol at all.

I mean, maybe it's the person.

So it's just something I've
observed, can't help but wonder

about this when I taught
research studies also.

Another thing I can't help
but thinking about when

I think about feeding
problems in particular

and things maybe working
with these very low intensity

problems that I'm willing to
take on given my own expertise,

and me saying I don't want to
take on very intense cases.

I'm not some huge
expert in this area,

is that the intensity of a
behavior makes a difference.

So when you talk about a kid
who's refusing to eat, well,

are they saying no, thank
you, and walking away?

Or are they throwing
a fork at you?

There's a difference there.

The intensity matters.

Or people talk about
severe problem behavior,

and people use that word, and
I think it sounds kind of cool.


So what makes it like mild?

I mean, I understand
what these terms mean,

but what exactly makes--

how can we know that this
study didn't work or did

work, and maybe the intensity
of the problem mattered?

Got it.

So I also wonder about
the therapist role.

So what other role
does the therapist

who's interaction with the
child, the person who's

implementing this intervention,
what other roles do they have?

So I only think
this in particular

when I see videos of four
people smiling around a child.

Now I only taken data
and doing all the things

that they should do
to do very good work,

but how is that different
form me asking a parent

to do that intervention
when their goal is not only

to collect data?

They have several roles.


Part of the context in which
interventions are implemented

in the real world
are by people who

are not only there to implement
your behavior plan, which

is why you have these conflicts
of people not collecting data

and you don't know why.

You think they're not listening
to you or something like that.

There's a whole bunch of
consulter consultee dilemmas

that happen.

But really it's
are you asking them

to do something that actually
isn't even done in the research

literature by people
who are in their role?

Interesting topic.

Distractions are a huge thing.

I have all sorts of
stories from students.

I don't think this worked
because I moved the table,

or somebody else
started sleeping here.

The whole situation
changes, right?

This is a complicated number
of people in the bedroom.

The setting matters.

And then, of course, behavior
analysts are, to my delight,

talking a lot more about
integrity failures lately.

I love that literature.

It seems to be growing
in recent times.

Very, very interesting
literature.

Oftentimes, I've
implemented some program

only to find out that it
was implemented a decade ago

for five years inappropriately.

That's interesting information.

We don't come into
situations as blank slate

kind of behavior analysts.

Our clients have oftentimes
had a number of interventions

before you got there.

And then of course,
other topics that I love

are sleep, diet, allergies,
all things that are here

and a part of if a child's
not sleeping, that's an issue.

Not the mother's
implementation of extinction.

The child needs to sleep.

So I hope that I highlighted
some ways that the context is

important to-- or questions that
I think researchers could ask,

and that you could ask
while you re-research.

OK so to sum up.

I think behavior analysts
do really good work.

I'm inspired by behavior
analysts all the time.

I often wonder if there
something else I should do.

I think this is something
that I do while I'm

stuck in traffic jams.

I blame Los Angeles for this.

It is always behavior analysis.

I am always committed to the
ideas of behavior analysis,

and I love the ideas that
behavior analysts hold dear

to them because they're
very, very helpful ideas.

So I hope that I've
told you some reasons

why thinking about
the context can

help us be even better behavior
analysts, and that's it.

Thank you.
