# Part 1

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510


00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.493
OK, so thank you for coming
to listen to me talk,

00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:09.348
and for inviting me
to this conference.

00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:11.420
[INAUDIBLE] introductions.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.390
It is true I am sort of a
conceptual theory philosophy

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.080
junkie, even if I
don't want to be.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.110
I just keep finding
myself talking

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.560
about conceptual issues, so
I guess I really like them.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.940
As the university
would say, I keep

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.404
doing what I'm
reinforced to doing.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:32.220
And I thought a lot
about this conference

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.480
and what I would
talk to you about,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.080
realizing that many of you
probably work with children

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.550
of autism spectrum disorder.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.690
I don't want to bore you
with some, I don't know,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.551
nuances of things that I think
are really important while I

00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.260
stare out my office window.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.250


00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.410
I teach applied
behavioral courses,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.110
and I've become increasingly
passionate about talking

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.670
to practitioners, in particular,
about why theory and philosophy

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.140
might matter to
you, and why I think

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.435
it's important for practitioners
to have some exposure to theory

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.670
and philosophy.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.370
And try to more than
just tell you that,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.850
but show you how it relates
to the work that you do.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.470
So anyway, that's my--

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't know if it's is
a warning or a rationale.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.700
OK, so I'm very inspired by the
work that behavior analysts do.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.590
I think about what
behavior analysts do a lot.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.740
I think a lot about what
students do that work with me.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.440
I've thought a lot
about what you all do.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.280
We all have a huge
opportunity to improve

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.180
the lives of the people
that we work with,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.940
and I think it's a very
serious job that we all do.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.160
So I went to school at
Western Michigan University.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.330
And if you are at all
familiar with Western Michigan

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.610
University, you know
that you're sort of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.650
forced to become exposed to
behavior analysis, if you

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.430
take any sort of
psychology course there.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.820
And I completely fell
in love with the ideas

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.160
of behavioral
analysis, and I think

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.710
that influences a lot of how we
look at problems in the world.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.345
We don't think problems
are inside of people.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:21.150
Many behavioral analysts
have heard of victim blaming.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.730
So we don't blame the victim.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.190
In this case, the victim would
be of a poor environment.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.310
And we assume that
behavior occurs

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.490
and is influenced by the
context in which it happens.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.660
So you have to understand
the context of behavior

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.910
if you want to
understand behavior.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.450
So I hope that, when we
talk about those two things,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.700
specifically-- and those are
just two assumptions that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.560
I'm going to talk about today,
the victim blaming issue,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.330
don't blame the victim, and
really examine the context--

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.150
that these aren't just things
that behavior analysts say,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.820
but they're really
things that are

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.250
a part of every single
thing that you do.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.590
So you really have to
understand these ideas,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.770
and if they're going
to influence your work,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.420
you probably have
to have a continued

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.910
exposure to these
ideas, and really

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.386
talk about them regularly.

00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:16.718


00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.650
The thing is, as
many of you know,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.670
and as we were
reminded when we were

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.770
talking about fad treatments,
these ideas are not normal.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.370
They're normal for us, and
they make a lot of sense,

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.320
but I guess literally, in
the technical way of defining

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.200
normalcy, most
people don't think

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.150
how behavioral analysts think.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.340
Most people do
think that behavior

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.810
is driven by something that can
never be found inside of you.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.560
So it's not surprising
that those same people

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.810
develop a bunch of
zany ideas to try

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.160
to create behavior problems.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.170
So at the core of
all this, there

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.634
is a difference, as far as
how we think about behavior.

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:04.590
And we live in the same world as
those zany ideas, which causes

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.350
a whole bunch of problems.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.540
It makes our lives
very stressful.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.420
We're trying to do
something helpful.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.009
We have to figure out how to
interact with these people.

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:15.050
We were talking about this
at lunch a little bit.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.700
It's very difficult. We're
also at risk, though,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.110
being behavioral analysts
who are living in that world,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.390
for falling into some
of those same footsteps.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.600
And if you were to look at
the data, I was thinking,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600
for the BCBAs who may
also be practicing

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.900
non-behavior, non
evidence-based practices,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.660
I can't help but think
that those may have

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.510
been slipping off the wagon.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.976
It's like, folks who got on the
bandwagon in graduate school,

00:04:41.976 --> 00:04:43.508
you fell off.

00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:47.100
Maybe you never got on
properly in the first place.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.240
So I see this all
the time, this sort

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.410
of quasi-behavioral person, who
was once maybe a behaviorist,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.180
but isn't very much a
behaviorist these days.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.460
And I can't help but think
that the world has just

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.294
influenced them.

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:03.990
And this would make
sense, given how

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.002
we are influenced
by our surroundings,

00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:11.450
and I don't think anybody
is entirely immune to this.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.200
So I think that,
at the same time,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.600
I'm telling you how
important this issue is.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.006
At the same time, I
think that probably--

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:23.895
and I'm not saying
this quite as boldly

00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:26.580
as I might to other audiences--

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.260
theory is underemphasized in
applied behavioral analytical

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.260
training programs, and
professional development,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.022
and more.

00:05:35.022 --> 00:05:36.980
I've even had people tell
me that it completely

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.546
doesn't matter.

00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:41.570
And it's oftentimes seen
that theory and philosophy

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.660
are completely
distinct from practice.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.540
I've wondered, and
I've gone to plenty

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.110
of theoretical talks in my
day, maybe theoretical folks

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.269
aren't very good at talking
to behavior analysts who

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:57.060
work with people who
are making differences

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.490
in the lives of the kids and
adults and everyone every day.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.790
And it could be that
that's the case.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.580
But I just keep thinking, and
as I talked myself into talking,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.340
if this is what keeps us
from being mentalists,

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.710
some of these ideas, from
collapsing into all that,

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.580
and from helping
people the best we can

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.330
and from avoiding victim blaming
and from examining the context

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.660
more thoroughly, and goodness.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.620
I don't know, it
might be my bias,

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.190
but I think we should
talk about it more.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.420
So that's why I'm here, talking
to you about this topic,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:38.500
in particular.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.870
It just keeps coming up
in my life, in my work,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.350
and I can't think of a
better way for me to--

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.010
something for me to talk
about to this audience.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.570
So this is what I'm
hoping to do today.

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.780
I'm going to talk about
behavioral contingencies

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.090
and context-- by the way,
sorry this font is so small,

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.410
I didn't realize the
setup ahead of time--

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.725
talk about some implications
of this distinction

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.580
between contingencies
and context

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.658
for practice, for
research, and then I'll

00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:14.728
finish revisiting some
of our assumptions

00:07:14.728 --> 00:07:19.280
about why behavior occurs,
and tying this in altogether.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.150
So most of you are probably
familiar with the term

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.550
contingency.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.737
I always say most,
because I do realize

00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:29.945
some behavioral analysts,
actually, in my experience,

00:07:29.945 --> 00:07:32.530
don't define this
term properly, to me.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.930
But that's perfectly fine.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.640
We're all figuring
things out together.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.045
But you know, for
example, that reinforcers

00:07:39.045 --> 00:07:43.220
should be delivered contingent
on a behavior, right?

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.940
And we assume that contingencies
influence challenging behavior.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.690
And if you were to ever take
a course in the functional

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.762
behavioral analysis and behavior
of functional assessment,

00:07:53.762 --> 00:07:56.450
you know that a
lot of that is all

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.620
about the manipulation of,
you've got it, contingencies.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.545
We've got to know something
about contingencies if we're

00:08:03.545 --> 00:08:04.670
behavioral analysts, right?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:08.340
This is really at the
core of what we do.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.150
Contingencies
emphasize consequences.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.870
So of course, if you
wanted to be technical,

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.850
and I'm all about being
technical, and to see

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.830
stimuli do matter.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.930
We talk about
discriminative stimuli.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.240
So I have Sds there, and
Sds also are important.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.860
They occasion behavior
because of their relationship

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.246
to consequences, though.

00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:32.220
It is important that
that is emphasized.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.230
What about MOs?

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.210
Other antecedent
variables that we love

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.230
to talk about, very important.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.255
They alter the value
of consequences

00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:42.409
and increased behavior
that has been reinforced

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.480
by those consequences.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.010
So this shouldn't be
surprising to all of us,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.340
because that's what we all do.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.967
This is how we improve
behavior that we work on

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:58.390
on a daily basis, as
consistent with Skinner's more

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.310
general offering to
approach, to understanding

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.540
why people behave.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.810
So I think this idea
has been very helpful.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.760
It certainly shifted focus
away from the individual.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.725
So early on I said one
of my favorite ideas

00:09:13.725 --> 00:09:15.770
about the behavior
analysis idea is totally

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.020
that keeps me falling in
love with behavioral analysis

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.710
is that we don't blame
people for their behavior.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.243
So a contingency is a great
construct, a great concept,

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:27.780
that turns away
from the individual,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.050
and towards the context.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.320
So the contingency
has been very helpful,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.700
in large part, because
it has shifted away focus

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.520
from something that doesn't
exist inside the individual

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.610
and towards some
part of the context.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:46.320
And like I said, it adds to
understanding the environment.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.680
So they've done
more than that, too.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.800
The contingency has
helped us focus.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.040
And I'm amazed--

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.380
I read, and re-read, and
re-read things as I prepare

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.690
for classes--

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:05.740
and look no further than very
detailed, well-designed skill

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:08.610
acquisition programs
for learners.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.890
It's amazing, some of the stuff
that behavioral analysts do.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.480
And step by step by step
by step, consideration

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.090
of all of the sequence of
skills and reinforcing this

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.060
before that, and then this.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.402
I mean, it's enough
to make you dizzy.

00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:24.643
It's very, very, very well-done.

00:10:24.643 --> 00:10:27.220
And the contingency
is what helped

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.820
people focus like
that, that we just

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.630
can't sort of wing it when
we're teaching people things.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.810
We have to deliberately
focus on specific skills.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.650
And then, of course,
look no further, again,

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.040
than the functional
analysis model

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.090
of examining
challenging behavior.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:46.249
The contingency has
been very helpful.

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:48.040
I mean, if you look
around towards articles

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.262
that talk about the reduction
in the use of punishment,

00:10:51.262 --> 00:10:53.910
less likely to have all
sorts of right adversive

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.780
procedures used, if you
have a functional behavioral

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.040
assessment done.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.360
That is all the
contingency right there,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.775
turning away from the individual
and towards the context.

00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:05.400
So I think these are
a really big deal.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.200


00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.370
So it's not surprising,
and I've already

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.946
used the word contingency more
than I would on a daily basis,

00:11:14.946 --> 00:11:17.370
but contigencies are at
the center of everything

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.110
that we do in
behavioral analysis.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.620
And some people would even
say that the contingency

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.830
is the subject matter
of our science.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.740
We study contingencies.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.940
And I remember--

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.140
I was thinking, when I was
making this presentation--

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.545
when I really got it, the
whole contingency thing.

00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:39.886
Like, finally, I was
like, oh my gosh,

00:11:39.886 --> 00:11:42.350
this behavior's occurring
because it's being reinforced.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:43.470
Of course.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.065
Oh my gosh, that behavior's
being reinforced, too.

00:11:46.065 --> 00:11:47.930
Wow, it's all being reinforced.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.190
And as a professor,
when my students

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.200
start thinking like
that, I'm like, good.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.240
You're getting the
contingency, and you're

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.049
getting this core issue that's
done a lot of good in society.

00:12:00.049 --> 00:12:01.840
So you hear things
like, if it's happening,

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.215
there must be a reinforcer,
and I think that's a good sign.

00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:06.965
As an audience member
of those statements,

00:12:06.965 --> 00:12:10.800
I'm always happy when people
say those sort of things.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.250
But I wonder if contingencies
aren't things that we study.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.290
A contingency is a description
of a pattern that we observe.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.510
A contingency is a
term, and philosophers

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.545
use the word construct.

00:12:25.545 --> 00:12:27.750
I think it turns
people off when I start

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.150
talking like this a little bit.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.480
I don't want to get into the
business of doing something

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.870
that many have done,
that is confusing

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.920
what we're interested in
with how talk about things.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.890
I mean, we are
interested in behavior.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.840
So we want to be
careful here not

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.770
to confuse our descriptions
of what we study,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.277
that being contingencies,
with our subject matter

00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:53.500
more generally.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.955
And I think this can
cause some misguidance.

00:12:55.955 --> 00:12:59.110
I think it can confuse us
a little bit in practice.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.410
I'm going to get to
practice things in a second.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.946
If you're already
lost because I'm

00:13:02.946 --> 00:13:04.320
boring you with
conceptual stuff,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.140
just give me five minutes.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.190
So we're interested in
studying behavioral environment

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:15.292
functional relations,
interactions.

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:19.880
I am slightly obsessed with
interbehaviorism, I suppose.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.410
And that's one of the things
I like about interbehaviorism,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.640
is the very word
interbehavior places

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.500
emphasis on this
interaction, that it's not

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.810
just behavior
occurring over there,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.704
it's behavior that's
occurring in a context.

00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:36.520
And I love the
context, as you'll soon

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.730
hear me talking about this.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.794
So added to this,
though, we're interested

00:13:40.794 --> 00:13:41.710
in these interactions.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.010
That's what our
subject matter is.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.220
These interactions don't
exist by themselves.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.510
They exist in a context.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.620
And interbehaviorists
like to use the word feel.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.120
That's neither here
nor there to me.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.400
But contingencies, for example,
are part of the situation.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.930
They aren't the thing
that you're working in.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.740
So the context is
much more broad, then,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.335
than the concept
of a contingency,

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:11.140
and it refers to the
full range of factors

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.460
that influence behavior,
including and situational

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:15.640
factors.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:19.890
And the context, then, is really
about the richness of behavior.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.330
And this is another one of my
favorite parts of behavior.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.270
It's complicated.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:26.700
There are a lot of
things going on.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.950
I'm just not talking up
here because you're all

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.270
looking at me.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.500
There's no looking
at me reinforcer.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.990
I have a whole history.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.070
I drove here.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.810
I slept.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.430
I ate.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:37.450
I got some coffee.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.660
I leave the lights are on.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.670
My computer's working.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.720
There's a lot going on.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.160
Behavior is complex, and
the context highlights that.

# PART 2

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830


00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.820
So most people
probably agree with me

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.990
when I say this sort of thing.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.110
But I don't know that the
role of the contingency,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.890
and it being at the forefront
of everything that we do,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.000
that we talk about, the
implications of that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.880
So we sometimes even
search for particular types

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.742
of contingencies
and reinforcers.

00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.200
And this is one of
the times that I

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.900
don't smile when I hear students
saying this kind of thing.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.130
So you hear behavioral
analysts say, oh, you know,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.090
the four functions.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.911
Or I discovered a
fifth, I heard a rumor.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.266
Some of you guys told me that.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.772
I heard a rumor, there's
a fifth function,

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:45.850
as though functions exist
somewhere off in space

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.280
and we might find
another one someday.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.170
Functions are relations.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.000
They are things
that behavior has.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.610


00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.570
So I just hope that
way of speaking,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.465
which I'm sure many
of you have heard,

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:05.360
and maybe you have said
it yourself at some point,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.400
is a consequence of getting
a little confused here,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.950
of what contingencies
are, what procedures are,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.900
in particular this case,
and probably overly

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.250
following a standardized
ritual of sequential analysis

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.790
procedure.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.970
But it puts us at risk for
overlooking the context,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.410
these ways of speaking.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.763
If you speak about contingencies
in such a strict way,

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:33.340
or at the outset, you might
miss the heart of the situation.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.650
And I think at best you
might only get a part of it.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.000
So here's a little diagram.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700
I know you probably don't like
that I have so many words,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.960
so I tried to put pictures.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.210
I'm horrible at making pictures.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.260
But there is a
contingency there,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.380
for those of you who
like visual things.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.175
And those are the three boxes.

00:01:51.175 --> 00:01:53.910
You can put in a, b, c
in them, if you'd like.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.080
But trying to just visually
display that, the context would

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.853
be the blue thing behind it,
that there is this contingency,

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:04.060
indeed, but there
is a whole situation

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.470
that that contingency
is occurring in.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.500
And honestly, those of you
who work in the field, that's

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.325
the situation you work in.

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:13.950
You don't work in contingencies.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.440
You work in people's homes
that are complicated.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.330
They are messy.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.920
Someone just got in a fight.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.630
Someone's sick.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.810
They're late.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.762
It's never those boxes.

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:24.220
But it's amazing,
at the same time,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.584
how useful those boxes are.

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.270
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.910
So anyway, if you focus on the
contingency from the outset,

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.310
these are things you
can find yourself

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.750
on the cusp of saying,
probably at this point and not

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.775
the context.

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:42.460
You might overlook
things, and those things

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.580
could be pretty important.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.340
I just want to make sure we're
on board, as far as where

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.500
I'm at so far.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.910
So I hope you can tell I'm
slightly paranoid about this.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.201
I hope I don't sound like a
bunch of theoretical babble

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:54.610
to you.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.530
And I hope that this doesn't
seem completely irrelevant,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.200
but I'm going to give
you some applied examples

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.860
and show situations where I've
been supervising students who

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.880
are working on the supervision
of BCBAs, where I've thought,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.730
gosh, someone is overly thinking
about contingencies, and not

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.260
enough about the
context, and I think

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.180
they'll stand out to
you in these issues.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.250
OK, so Mitch is a very
interesting client

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.370
that you're working with.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.227
He engages in challenging
behavior, not me.

00:03:29.227 --> 00:03:33.433
You're a good behavior
analyst, and you do an FBA.

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.572
You do an indirect assessment.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:38.692
Maybe you do several of them, if
you like indirect assessments.

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:41.780
You conduct observations,
and you even

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.520
conduct a functional analysis.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.960
So you're a very cool
behavior analyst.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.310
You do the conditions
and everything,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.240
and manipulate the
[INAUDIBLE] and whatnot,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.370
a very detailed procedure.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.032
I'm not reminding you at all.

00:03:56.032 --> 00:03:58.165
I'm not.

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.290
But you determine that
Mitch's challenging behavior

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.300
is maintained by
attention, especially

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.122
the nanny's attention.

00:04:04.122 --> 00:04:06.470
By the way, this
could be an LA thing.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.470
I hear this a lot.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.970


00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.970
[INAUDIBLE] talk
about nannies all day.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.890
So as a behavioral
analyst, though, I

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.630
bet you have some good ideas.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.662
So you probably think about
functional and communication

00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:25.720
training.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.930
You might teach Mitch
to ask for attention

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.490
in an appropriate way.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.830
You might also
recommend extinction.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.570
You could withhold
the attention when

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.510
Mitch engages in the
challenging behavior,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.078
and maybe you might
also think about

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.286
non-contingent reinforcement.

00:04:39.286 --> 00:04:41.050
Maybe you should give
Mitch some attention

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.960
when he's not engaging
in the problem behavior.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.430
Now, of course,
these interventions

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.446
interact with each
other in detailed ways

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:51.990
that I'm not talking
about right now, as far as

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.666
teaching someone to
request attention,

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:55.290
and while at the same
time, giving them

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.204
contingent attention.

00:04:56.204 --> 00:04:58.940
That could be a problem,
but anyway, not the problem

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.420
I'm talking about today.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.123
But you can see this common
function-based intervention.

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:07.760


00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.160
And I love the whole,
you do an assessment.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.030
It tells you what
it is, and then

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.570
you just do something
completely related.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.710
It's all connected.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.360
By the way, it is
difficult enough

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.090
to get this sort of thing
happening, in my experience,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.562
to make sure
there's a continuity

00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:27.470
between the assessment
and the intervention.

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:28.970
So I think this
will probably result

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.545
in the behavior decreasing.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:33.560
But I wonder if your
goal is really just

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.270
to get the behavior to decrease.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.080
So we know that
behavior can decrease

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.920
for a variety of
reasons, including

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.980
medication and
punishment, some of which

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.575
could include band-aid
type interventions.

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:49.504
I knew that Dr. [INAUDIBLE]
was going to be here today.

00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:52.098
I think I got that idea from
some chapter that he wrote.

00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:53.090
Couldn't find it.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.180
I love that idea, though.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.745
I love the idea that we
love effects in behavior.

00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:03.840
And so if we see a behavior
go down, we think we got it.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.790
And I guess, in some
ways, that's good.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.260
We want to have some
kind of an effect.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.870
But this band-aid idea being
like, you didn't really get it.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.730
And you're going to
have to always have that

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.567
there, because they
could always come

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:19.400
right back if the
intervention were missing.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.620
Great idea.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.060
So you find an
attention function

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.712
and you find a
contingency, but you

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:26.170
have to remember
that contingencies

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.130
are part of a context.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.350
So think about Mitch and his
attention from his nanny.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.610
What if Mitch has a
pretty boring life?

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.050
Or maybe there's a general
lack of stimulation.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.610
What about Mitch's friends?

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.745
Does he have any?

00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:44.030
At this point, I don't
like this example

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:48.496
It seems kind of
personal of something.

00:06:48.496 --> 00:06:50.886
It was too late for
me to switch it.

00:06:50.886 --> 00:06:53.754
I was like, OK.

00:06:53.754 --> 00:06:56.320
Maybe Mitch doesn't need
functional communication

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.310
training, though, like
extinction, or even NCR.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.903
Maybe he needs to learn how to
make friends and get a life.

00:07:05.903 --> 00:07:08.000
Now, I don't mean
that in a bad way,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.270
but that's part of all of
us developing as people,

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.040
learning how to contact
reinforcers that

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.330
are in our environment, not
just how to request reinforcers,

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.070
in this case, from the nanny.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.650
So you can think of social
skills and community

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.820
involvement as function-based
intervention for Mitch,

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.840
in this situation, which seems
a little out of, I think,

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.030
the ballpark of what
behavior analysts typically

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.260
talk about when they talk about
treating challenging behavior.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.270
But if you think about
this particular person,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.700
I can't help but think a
function-based intervention

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.146
involves helping Mitch get some
things going in the real world

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:48.034
that Mitch lives in.

00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.870


00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.520
So I'll be a little
faster with Mitch2.0 here,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.990
but I like some examples
of highlighting this.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.585
He throws objects at school.

00:07:59.585 --> 00:08:01.040
He's naughty.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.930
You determine through
your, again, behavior

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.480
analytic skills, that his
naughty behavior is maintained

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.340
by escape.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.710
You've even done
several analyzes

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.400
to confirm that this
is the function.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.860
So you've ran out a bunch
of really detailed things,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.630
and it's definitely that,
at the end of the day.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.120
So again, you probably
recommend things, as I think

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.880
is a good sign.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.420
Functional
communication training,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.355
teach me to request
a break, give me

00:08:30.355 --> 00:08:32.120
some non-contingent breaks.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.679
Maybe if you're ambitious, you
might use extinction therapy.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.039
You might get a
burst, I don't know.

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.539
But the behavior goes down.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:46.970
So you see an effect,
though, again.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.100
But again, I want you
to think of the context.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.950
So as soon as I hear about an
escape maintained behavior,

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.640
anytime a student tells me
about this, I always say,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.520
why is the context aversive?

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.080
I would not jump to using
an extinction procedure,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.570
or break card, or any of
that stuff that is just

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.270
run-of-the-mill applied
behavior analysis.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.160
Think, what is going on?

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.770
Why is that situation aversive?

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.140
So has a detailed
skills assessment

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.950
been conducted,
just for example?

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.590
As many of you know, kids go
through school grade by grade.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.116
I'm shocked that there isn't
more challenging behavior

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:31.550
related to academic demands,
because academic demands don't

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.860
seem to be individualized.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.040
So it would make sense
for a challenging behavior

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.260
to develop if you ask
me to do something

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.106
that I'm not prepared to do.

00:09:40.106 --> 00:09:44.570
Simple idea, usually not a
part of a common vernacular.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.252
Maybe an intervention
would be tutoring.

00:09:48.252 --> 00:09:51.440
In your behavior plan,
you include tutoring,

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.600
that there are some academic
skills development that

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.820
needs to happen before you even
deal with this behavior problem

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.110
at all.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.304
This is a situation that
there's academic skills deficit.

00:10:03.304 --> 00:10:06.026
Or maybe you should reconsider
the component skills

00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:07.840
for what's happening.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.800
Great skill set for the
behavior analyst to develop.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.770
Or maybe somebody
makes fun of Mitch

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.600
in only one of the classes.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.920
So maybe somebody makes fun
of this hypothetical client,

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.720
but it's only in math.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.050
And sooner or later,
Mitch has a math label

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.316
that he'd behind in
math or something.

00:10:26.316 --> 00:10:27.770
He has remedial
services in math,

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.530
and it's all because
someone's teasing him in math.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.660
Or maybe someone teased
him in math two years ago

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:38.150
and he fell behind and
nobody really caught him up.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.920
So I just want you
to think, though,

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.670
with these two examples here
so far, that maybe absentee

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:47.214
and escape extension, and all
of that other stuff, very,

00:10:47.214 --> 00:10:50.240
very, very, good interventions
that do great things,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.820
don't really get at the issue
for this particular person.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.640


00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.780
OK, the last little example I
want to show you is another,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.650
it's a briefer one.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.340
But You another thing I
think about the context

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.690
when I think about
parents, not surprisingly.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.780
But I think of parent training,
and what I've called--

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.734
I wrote a paper about
this awhile ago,

00:11:14.734 --> 00:11:18.365
where I talked about the
train and train more model

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:19.240
of behavior analysts.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.470
So training them, training
them, they don't get it.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:22.880
Train them more.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.980
They just don't get it.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.721
They refuse to comply.

00:11:26.721 --> 00:11:30.980
So if this happens
for a long time,

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.055
and you've done good
behavior analytic training,

00:11:34.055 --> 00:11:37.220
as I hope you learn to do
in your graduate training

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:41.330
programs, then I wonder if there
is something about the context.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:47.490
It's not that they need more
training, it's something else.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.220
So one obvious factor that some
of you probably have noticed

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.540
is the amount of stress
that some parents

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.974
of children with disabilities
face in their day-to-day lives.

00:11:56.974 --> 00:12:01.290
Parents, in general,
have a lot of stress.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:03.150
If you have a child
with disability,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.740
there's even more chances that
you have a very stressful life.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.620
There's a lot going on,
a lot to think about.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.800
So add to that situation
a behavior consultant

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.230
repeatedly asking you
to role play something

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.930
again, because you did
not meet some criteria

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:24.164
or something, which is all good
to have as good [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:27.010
But you should think
about the context there.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.220
What is the real issue?

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.550
So you can't help
but think, gosh,

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.512
maybe this individual's team,
that you're working with,

00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:40.170
should think about
a respite program.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.680
Maybe the family is
exhausted, and they

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.050
need to have a
weekend to take a nap,

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:51.880
go shopping, or do anything
that anybody needs to do.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.180
So it could be that if
you recommended something

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.220
like that, or you
worked with a team

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.480
to have something
like that happen,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:02.710
you might get at the actual
issue of what's happening.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.240
So anyway, each
of these examples

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.050
highlight how a narrow focus
on the contingencies alone,

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.390
without thinking
of the context, may

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.170
be to a less ineffective
intervention plan.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.000
Just some quick examples.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.460
I hear these examples
all day long.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.110
I thought, gosh, maybe I
should start to make a list.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.760
But it's important to
remember that contingencies,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.240
while they're exceptionally
useful constructs,

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.730
they are at the heart of
everything that we do.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.070
And they should be.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:36.220
You should not confuse them
with the broader situation

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.750
that you're working in.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.330
So you need to
examine contingencies.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.145
You need to think
about contingencies,

00:13:42.145 --> 00:13:45.580
but don't close your eyes
to the rest of the situation

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.030
that you're working in.

# PART 3

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820


00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.880
So I have a little PR note
for us here as a field.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.390
I want us to notice
how a conceptual issue,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.640
like the definition of the
subject matter of behavior

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.210
analysis, has such large
implications for how

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.170
we go about solving
problems in the real world.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.510
So I wonder, and I know that
this question sort of lingers

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.980
over a lot of practitioners,
does theoretical mumbo

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.330
jumbo matter?

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.895
I don't know what theoretical
mumbo jumbo does or doesn't.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.430
Maybe it does now,
but gosh, it seems

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.880
that some of it, well,
that's my opinion here,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.680
the resounding yes seems
to slap me across the face

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.430
almost every day.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.020
Theoretical issues are super
important to everything

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.820
that you do.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.130
It's a very difficult job
that behavior analysts have,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.385
and I can help but think
who they could execute

00:00:55.385 --> 00:01:01.130
that job really well over time
without constantly revisiting

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.700
some of these conceptual issues.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.350
I'll try to fly through this
remaining section more quickly.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.340
So this whole context
thing, hopefully, I've

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.080
sort of sold you a little bit
about the context in practice.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.810
This whole context
thing has a lot

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.942
of implications for how you
understand research as well,

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.020
and I oftentimes
hear practitioners

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.519
talk about research as, no, it
doesn't really get at kind of--

00:01:31.519 --> 00:01:32.060
I don't know.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.020
It just doesn't seem to
work where I am, right?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.730
You read that article, but now I
have to go to somebody's house,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.250
right?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.870
That was very--
you know, there's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.890
this thing there that's clear.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.510
I have felt that, right?

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.284
I was a student, and
I memorized articles,

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:56.525
and then I went to classrooms
where there were things

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:58.010
flying all over the room.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.340
So I think that how
you look at research

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.876
can be helped by thinking of
the context in which research

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:07.982
was conducted.

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:11.240
And more over, for those of
you that are researchers,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.392
I think that better
research questions,

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:18.655
or continued research
questions could be developed

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.450
by thinking about the context.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.860
So most of my experience
with research, by the way,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.750
has been with graduate students.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.640
I like working with
students myself,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.040
but while it's all
been interesting,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.920
and I've slowly developed
a research repertoire,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.800
it's got a lot of work to do.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.300
There are some
things that stand out

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.580
to me when I do research
studies with students.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.920
Some questions.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.384
So I wonder why do
things work with me

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:49.310
and my students when they don't
in the research literature?

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.022
And why don't
things work with us

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:54.320
when they do in the
research literature.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.950
I just constantly had these
questions as a gradate student,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.399
and I continue to have
them as a professor.

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:01.896
Here's a thing, it works.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:02.894
Tried it, flatline.

00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:07.884


00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:09.381
Love that study, right?

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.876
Spent a lot of time
[INAUDIBLE],, flatline.

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:14.890


00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.542
You know, one thing
that I've worked on,

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:19.970
and I'm not talking about
picky eating as a topic,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.765
but one thing that I've worked
on with graduate students just

00:03:22.765 --> 00:03:24.560
as a topic that they
were interested in,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.020
and we've sort of developed
some studies in this area,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.310
is picky eating.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.260
As many of you know
that work with children

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.360
with autism spectrum
disorder, picky eating

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.620
is a very common topic.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.570
You're probably likely
to confront this topic

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.320
at some point in your
professional career.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.580
I hope that you do so in an
interdisciplinary fashion,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.660
and you really rule out any
other sort of complication

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.674
that contribute to this.

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:50.780
I'm less talking about
picky eating as a topic,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.740
and more about an example of
the research kind of story.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.240
So much of the
research in this area

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.070
has been conducted in
clinic-based settings.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.727
If you've ever delved into
that research literature,

00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:03.810
you'll notice that it has.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.061
It's very good
literature, by the way.

00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:07.889
I love the feeding literature.

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.540
It's very interesting, very
systematic, very well done.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.760
One thing that you'll
see over and over

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.329
is the finding that extinction
seems to be required.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.800
So basically, that you need
to extinguish the escape

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.920
or avoidance
procedure, and that's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.400
very helpful towards
improving acceptance

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.330
and consumption of food.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.710
If you look at the basic
contingency analysis here,

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.130
you've got non-preferred food.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.006
The child says no, does
something else inappropriate,

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:36.350
and then there's no
non-preferred food.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.160
Hey, [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.330
So it's good news in that we
have this finding that we can

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.540
disrupt these contingencies.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.930
But it's difficult to implement
extinction procedures,

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.140
especially escape
extinction procedures.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.120
There can be a number
of side effects.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.640
Goodness, if any
of you have ever

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.056
thought about
treatment integrity,

00:05:00.056 --> 00:05:03.516
it's enough to make you almost
never recommend extinction,

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:05.790
because if you give
in occasionally,

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.290
you make it worse.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.930
So I always think of times
where I told parents,

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.878
can you do this
almost perfectly?

00:05:13.878 --> 00:05:16.273
[INAUDIBLE]

00:05:16.273 --> 00:05:21.542


00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:25.620
It could be dangerous
if you're not careful.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.670
So I've completely avoided
this topic as far as something

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:35.010
that I dare to actually attempt
to use with graduate students.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.740
So I have kind of dabbled
around in examining

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.030
antecedent interventions.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.010
But antecedent
interventions are just

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.800
the sort of interventions
that are shown to not work.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.040
So it's interesting to me
because in my experience

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.280
they oftentimes do.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.790
So I wonder sometimes they do
work, sometimes they don't.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.885
Here we are.

00:06:01.885 --> 00:06:04.020
there's mixed evidence
on this particular topic

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.190
as an example of an issue in
the research literature, so

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.585
where do you go from there?

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:11.950
Where do you go when sometimes
something works and sometimes

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.450
it doesn't.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.445
The high P sequence is a
great example this, right?

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.930
There are a bunch of examples
of this behavioral momentum

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.050
idea working.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.060
I can't tell you how often
I can remember sitting

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.707
in a chair working with a kid.

00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:25.206
High-five.

00:06:25.206 --> 00:06:26.000
What's your name?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.140
What's your name?

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.800
Now do this.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.780
No.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.750
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.812
I read it.

00:06:32.812 --> 00:06:37.220
I was a good [INAUDIBLE],,
developed a protocol, flatline.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.460


00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.820
Sometimes that procedure
works very well.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.210
Many of you probably
know that too.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.990
So it is just
interesting when you're

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.700
in these situations, what do
you do when it works sometimes,

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.390
and it doesn't other times?

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.140
What do you know what
to do in a situation?

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.460
As a practitioner of work
with people in the world,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.300
what do you do?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.140
So I think, like I
often think, you end up

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.656
having to think about
the subject matter.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:09.530
What are you actually studying?

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.320
What are you interested in?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.270
Not surprisingly, when I
think of these two questions

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.730
that I mentioned
earlier, I think

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.280
that we have to end up
going back to the content.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.160
So if you really want
to answer questions

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.610
about why behavior occurs
in specific contexts,

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.900
you've got to know more
about the specific context.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.305
So some of the things
that I've thought

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:36.870
about while I've looked at the
research literature-- well,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.380
give me a second.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:41.930
This is just to make
sure I didn't lose you.

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.920
So we're all good on don't
place too much emphasis

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.830
on consequences.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.290
I mean, consequences are great.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.910
Contingencies are great.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.470
They're very,
very, very helpful.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:53.520
Careful, remember,
behavior occurs

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.880
in a very complicated context.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.593
One that you all probably
know a lot more about that I

00:07:57.593 --> 00:07:59.140
do frankly.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.350
Much better though,
even if you were

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.231
to focus on contingencies
and not anything else,

00:08:04.231 --> 00:08:06.780
you'd be doing better
than mentalists.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.690
At least your focusing on
something in the environment.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.650
You're turning away from
all that victim blame.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.620
So if you're going
to follow something.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.380
People love to follow
rules and protocols

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.560
and that sort of thing.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.235
If you're going
to do that, follow

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:25.762
one that's based on
contingencies lest you possible

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:26.982
go mentalistic.

00:08:26.982 --> 00:08:29.910


00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.320
But when I think about
understanding research

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.620
and it relates to improving the
lives of people in community

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.270
settings or in complex
situations, when

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.809
I look at research articles,
I look at them more and more

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:44.586
differently over time.

00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:46.790
I ask students to do so too.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.330
But one thing that
has really come up,

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:50.870
and again, this
one in particular

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.125
comes out of me
knowing a lot of people

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:57.310
who work in the field, that
work in agencies, own agencies.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.130
There's a therapist
client relationship thing

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.740
that is pretty amazing that
behavior analysts don't

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.870
talk about more.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.280
And I can't help but think that
sometimes when a study works,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.780
I'm like, who was
that therapist?

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.860
You said praise was
provided, how did that look?

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.230
We're they really like good?

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:27.715
I mean, anybody that supervises
services knows that there's

00:09:27.715 --> 00:09:29.410
a good therapist effect.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.130
I've heard people say I could
ask so and so to do anything,

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.160
and it would work.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.070
Well, gosh, then maybe it's
not so much about that thing

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.060
that they're doing, it's
about that person's behavior.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.150
How are they implementing
that intervention?

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.770
What do they do
that is so special?

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.450
What's their history with
the kids that they work with?

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:54.955
So this good therapist effect I
think is a really [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:58.620
Honestly, as someone who's
supervised a bunch of studies

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.400
over the years at this
point, I can't help

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.760
but think sometimes when
it doesn't work, OK,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.393
you're following the protocol
to a T, but you're not really--

00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:13.337


00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:17.245
you're not doing it, you know?

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:21.456
And other times, it's like you
follow the protocol to a T,

00:10:21.456 --> 00:10:23.820
and it totally works.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.760
Wow.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.980
But maybe it's not
the protocol at all.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.710
I mean, maybe it's the person.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.830
So it's just something I've
observed, can't help but wonder

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.601
about this when I taught
research studies also.

00:10:37.601 --> 00:10:39.684
Another thing I can't help
but thinking about when

00:10:39.684 --> 00:10:41.960
I think about feeding
problems in particular

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.555
and things maybe working
with these very low intensity

00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:50.160
problems that I'm willing to
take on given my own expertise,

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.606
and me saying I don't want to
take on very intense cases.

00:10:53.606 --> 00:10:57.000
I'm not some huge
expert in this area,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.990
is that the intensity of a
behavior makes a difference.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.950
So when you talk about a kid
who's refusing to eat, well,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.840
are they saying no, thank
you, and walking away?

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.324
Or are they throwing
a fork at you?

00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:11.395
There's a difference there.

00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:13.490
The intensity matters.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.085
Or people talk about
severe problem behavior,

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:19.265
and people use that word, and
I think it sounds kind of cool.

00:11:19.265 --> 00:11:22.110


00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.080
So what makes it like mild?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.100
I mean, I understand
what these terms mean,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.545
but what exactly makes--

00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:33.662
how can we know that this
study didn't work or did

00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:38.000
work, and maybe the intensity
of the problem mattered?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.900
Got it.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.050
So I also wonder about
the therapist role.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.375
So what other role
does the therapist

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:49.380
who's interaction with the
child, the person who's

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.260
implementing this intervention,
what other roles do they have?

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.320
So I only think
this in particular

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:02.200
when I see videos of four
people smiling around a child.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.810
Now I only taken data
and doing all the things

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.600
that they should do
to do very good work,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.660
but how is that different
form me asking a parent

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.310
to do that intervention
when their goal is not only

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.976
to collect data?

00:12:19.976 --> 00:12:20.975
They have several roles.

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:24.440


00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.970
Part of the context in which
interventions are implemented

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.550
in the real world
are by people who

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:35.410
are not only there to implement
your behavior plan, which

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.132
is why you have these conflicts
of people not collecting data

00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:39.090
and you don't know why.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.673
You think they're not listening
to you or something like that.

00:12:41.673 --> 00:12:44.800
There's a whole bunch of
consulter consultee dilemmas

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.720
that happen.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.620
But really it's
are you asking them

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.180
to do something that actually
isn't even done in the research

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.510
literature by people
who are in their role?

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.100
Interesting topic.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.990
Distractions are a huge thing.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:02.874
I have all sorts of
stories from students.

00:13:02.874 --> 00:13:06.160
I don't think this worked
because I moved the table,

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.955
or somebody else
started sleeping here.

00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:14.920
The whole situation
changes, right?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.430
This is a complicated number
of people in the bedroom.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.800
The setting matters.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.282
And then, of course, behavior
analysts are, to my delight,

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:26.407
talking a lot more about
integrity failures lately.

00:13:26.407 --> 00:13:27.840
I love that literature.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.000
It seems to be growing
in recent times.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.300
Very, very interesting
literature.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.610
Oftentimes, I've
implemented some program

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.730
only to find out that it
was implemented a decade ago

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.462
for five years inappropriately.

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:45.410
That's interesting information.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.250
We don't come into
situations as blank slate

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:49.610
kind of behavior analysts.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.100
Our clients have oftentimes
had a number of interventions

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.107
before you got there.

00:13:54.107 --> 00:13:55.940
And then of course,
other topics that I love

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.550
are sleep, diet, allergies,
all things that are here

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:06.900
and a part of if a child's
not sleeping, that's an issue.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.852
Not the mother's
implementation of extinction.

00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:12.790
The child needs to sleep.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.125
So I hope that I highlighted
some ways that the context is

00:14:16.125 --> 00:14:19.562
important to-- or questions that
I think researchers could ask,

00:14:19.562 --> 00:14:22.570
and that you could ask
while you re-research.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:25.322
OK so to sum up.

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:27.430
I think behavior analysts
do really good work.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.826
I'm inspired by behavior
analysts all the time.

00:14:30.826 --> 00:14:32.950
I often wonder if there
something else I should do.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.824
I think this is something
that I do while I'm

00:14:34.824 --> 00:14:35.930
stuck in traffic jams.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.952
I blame Los Angeles for this.

00:14:37.952 --> 00:14:41.720
It is always behavior analysis.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.490
I am always committed to the
ideas of behavior analysis,

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:49.450
and I love the ideas that
behavior analysts hold dear

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.900
to them because they're
very, very helpful ideas.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.920
So I hope that I've
told you some reasons

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.485
why thinking about
the context can

00:14:58.485 --> 00:15:02.600
help us be even better behavior
analysts, and that's it.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.450
Thank you.
