WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.020


00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.420
There we go, great.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.500
So thank you.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.020
I am a New Yorker at heart.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.360
I've worked hard to
drop the accent though.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.760
So as long as my sister
isn't in the audience,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.640
I probably won't speak
like a New Yorker.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.160
If I get on the phone
with her, it's a problem.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.170
So I was asked by Rob to
come to this conference.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.240
And this is one of my
very favorite conferences

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.650
to come to.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.350
I guess like Rob,
I have an affinity

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.640
for places that
are very beautiful.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.310
And this is very,
very beautiful,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.050
but it's also always a really
warm and welcoming group.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.920
And he also asked me to
talk about a topic that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.490
was really high interest
and really appealing

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.060
to me, which was how we could
use the science of behavior

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.170
to teach compassion skills
for working with families.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.690
And I think that
this is something

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.380
that we have a lot of consensus
and a lot of convergence

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.460
in the field right now.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.150
About a number of articles
that I'll talk about

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.700
in the presentation have come
out in the last few years

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.100
to kind of get us
thinking about this.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.550
To maybe start identifying
some of the skills that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.320
might be important in developing
this as an essential skill

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.130
set for practitioners.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.040
And I guess it also really
resonates with me because it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.080
brings me back to my own roots.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.980
When I got my PhD, it was
in clinical psychology,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.450
and it was with Dr. Sandra
Harris and colleagues

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.200
at Rutgers University
who were very

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.160
passionate about understanding
family stress and family

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.120
experience.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.230
And about helping individuals
and their families

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.430
develop coping
strategies for the impact

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.620
that autism had on
the entire family.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.590
And so it's always
been close to my heart

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.530
and always been an area of
ongoing clinical and research

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.600
interest to look at how we can
maximize families, expertise,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.560
and adaptation.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.490
And increasingly over
the last few years

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.430
in my own clinical
research and teaching,

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.070
I've become very
interested in how

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.360
we can teach this better to
practicing behavior analysts

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.430
and to students of
behavior analysis.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.200
So hopefully what will
result from this talk

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.350
is that you'll come out
thinking about some new ways

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.740
to possibly address some of
these skills in teaching,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.140
in training, and supervision.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.460
And it will get us all to
thinking about the next level

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.140
of compassionate care skills.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.640
I want to start by thanking the
Cambridge Center for inviting

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.510
me and having me out.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.800
I do want to thank my mentors,
my supervisors, my students,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.910
my colleagues, especially
Sandra Harris--

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.970
she really did instill
in me, in particular,

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.420
a real commitment to helping
the families of those impacted

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.110
by autism.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.010
And then two of my students,
a former student Samantha

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.360
Rousseau, who's really helped
a lot in research applications

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.640
of this area, and
Nancy Marcheezy

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.720
who is beginning her
dissertation in our program

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.180
and who is focused on this area.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.310
And I always like to thank
the families of people

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.770
with autism, because if
I have anything to say

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.300
it's because of
everything they've

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.800
taught me about the experience.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.300
These are members of my current
research lab at Endicott,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.420
and one of the things we've been
studying all year-- we always

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.510
have a joint project
every year, this year it's

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.530
been on collaboration and the
development of collaboration

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.260
skills.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.870
Particularly in
interdisciplinary

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.480
collaboration, but
we also are very

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.820
interested in family support.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.160
So all of them have
contributed in part

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.890
to some of what I'm
going to say today.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.570
So in thinking about
compassionate care,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.450
I think it's important for
us to first pause and talk

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.780
about the impact of autism
and the impact of autism

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.670
on the family in particular.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.630
And in general, as service
providers, when we do this,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.900
we focus on the
individual with autism,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.279
and that's not surprising
because the struggles

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.970
are pretty significant.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.279
The areas of need are multiple.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.340
And we focus on
behavioral excesses,

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.870
we focus on skill deficits.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.790
We know there's a
window of opportunity,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.100
and we have to act
quickly in order

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.990
to have the best outcomes.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.200
And we know that
those outcomes vary.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.320
So there's a tremendous
amount of attention, focus,

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.530
and precision in the way in
which we address the needs

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.990
of the individual with autism.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.250
But we know that the impact of
autism goes beyond the child.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.810
We know that the
impact of autism

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.300
extends to all members of the
family, including parents,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.570
including siblings,
including grandparents

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.617
and extended family.

00:04:57.617 --> 00:04:59.950
And so I'm going to kind of
broaden the station a little

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.590
before we get into the skill
building portion of this

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.240
and talk about stress.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.950
And what we know about stress
and its impact on us as humans.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.070
And so I'm not going
to talk about stress

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.790
in the context of autism or
parenting a child with autism--

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.430
I'm going to talk first about
what do we know from the stress

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.480
literature?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.900
What do we know about
the nature of stress?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.870
And I think it's really
interesting and instructive,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.630
and whenever I think
about this, I think wow,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.060
this is amazingly
relevant to the provision

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.875
of services for families
of children with autism.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.500
Because if you look
at that literature,

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.590
it tells you things that
in a way are no brainers,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.890
but still I think are really
interesting to reflect on.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.770
One of them is that it's harder
to cope with the stressor

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.832
that's longer duration.

00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:48.040
And you all know that, right.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.690
It's easier to run a sprint
than to run a marathon.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.720
It's also true that it's
harder to cope with stressors

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.820
that are higher in intensity--

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.120
that present more
intense challenges.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.130
And the last two, I think,
are really interesting.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.050
One is ambiguity.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.130
It's harder to cope
with a situation that's

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.670
ambiguous in nature, where
all the answers are not in.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.570
Think about other examples in
terms of medical diagnoses.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.700
You get a cancer
diagnosis and you

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.180
don't know whether that means
you have a few years to live

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.190
or you're going to go
through a few rough months

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.690
and you're going to be OK.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.630
That's incredibly
stressful for people.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.620
In the same way, autism can
be a very ambiguous diagnosis

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.420
to a parent of a young child.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.050
You know, you might end up
doing a lot of intensive work

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.910
for a few years and
they may be essentially

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.570
OK in regular public education
with minimal supports

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:44.770
or no supports.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.310
Or you may need
lifelong custodial care

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.020
for this individual.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.060
And we don't know, right.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.310
It doesn't really get
much more ambiguous

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.550
than that for families
in that situation.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.990
And then the last one
is rarity of experience.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.990
And I think this is
interesting because we think

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.370
about incidence and prevalence.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.990
We think of this as not rare.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.940
We think of this as much more
common than it's ever been.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.690
And certainly when I started
graduate school in 1984,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.540
no one I ever spoke to had
ever heard of autism, right.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.890
They were like, you
work with artistic kids?

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.160
And so in that way, we certainly
have a very different world

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.350
in terms of people's
awareness of autism,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.740
yet most parents of
individuals with autism

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.920
don't really know someone
in their inner circle who

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.960
have an individual with
autism in their family.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.720
They don't have a close friend.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.310
Most of them don't have
another family member.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.230
And so we can still feel
very rare and very isolating

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.530
in a way that maybe
we're not tuning into.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.052


00:07:46.052 --> 00:07:48.010
So that's all about the
nature of the stressor.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.635
We know that the
nature of the stressor

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.940
impacts the negative
effects of coping,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.687
right, the negative
effects of stress.

00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:55.270
But there are a
couple of other things

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.620
that also predict
negative outcomes.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.400
One is the number
of daily hassles.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.020
And in other words,
the harder it

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.940
is for you to get
through your day.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.550
The more negative
effects of stress

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.570
you're likely to have
from whatever stressor

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:08.920
you're experiencing.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.640
That seems especially relevant
for parents of individuals

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.300
on the spectrum who have to
plan their day, their outings,

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.500
their vacations,
everything, with a variety

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.590
of idiosyncratic issues in mind.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.830
And then the third thing is
low levels of social support.

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.570
And low levels of
social support,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.910
again, in any
stressful circumstance

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.429
you're talking
about are predicted

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:37.304
with higher negative
impact of those stressors.

00:08:37.304 --> 00:08:39.429
I think one thing that's
really interesting to look

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.860
at in the psychology and
counseling literature

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.470
is what's found within social
support to be most helpful.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.190
And the finding that I
find the most intriguing

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.500
is that one of the most
important dimensions

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.950
of social support is
perceived availability.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.440
Meaning that people
answer the question,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.340
I have somebody to
talk to about xy or z.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.430
I have somebody to talk to about
my son's behavior problems.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.130
I have someone to talk
to about my marital woes.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.550
The extent to which people
answer that question, yes,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.040
means they have a high
perceived availability.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.280
What's really interesting
to me about those data

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.340
is that it doesn't actually
matter whether those people

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.920
receive social support.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.580
That impact, that
positive insulating effect

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.250
of perceived availability
is true whether or not

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.350
you ever access that support.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.260
That's a little weird to
me as a behavior analyst,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.910
right, because it
doesn't actually

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.780
matter in terms of contacting
real world support,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.530
but it speaks to isolation.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.140
Right, in terms of I
don't feel so alone I

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.410
would have someone if
I needed someone that I

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.600
could talk to about that.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.250
It's also true that
people are helped

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.310
by having an avenue for
emotional expression,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.210
a place they can vent.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.570
Someone who can tolerate their
negative emotionality-- that's

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.760
really important for
siblings of individuals

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.590
on the spectrum to
have particularly

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.030
within their own family unit.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:14.120
It's also helpful to have
formal supports, things

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.620
like our parent
training programs,

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.580
education programs of
all kinds are helpful.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.410
And there's a unique
kind of support

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.380
that comes from knowing
others in a similar situation.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.630
And we certainly see that
clinically in the work

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.410
we do with individuals
on the spectrum in terms

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.500
of the support they find in
connecting with one another

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:36.420
in parent support contexts.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.960
And then there are some
other variables that

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.030
come out in coping literature.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.170
Again, not really specific
to autism or to parenting

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.700
a person with autism.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.730
But it's true that in
stressful situations,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.780
people seem to be helped
and insulated by things

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.390
like a sense of control, right.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.000
Believing that
they can influence

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.190
the outcomes of situations.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.360
Commitment-- a sense of
purpose or mission, a broader

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.850
engagement with the cause.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.830
And something that
you might call a can

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.520
do attitude or a glass
is half full attitude.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.780
Seeing things as challenges
versus catastrophes,

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.700
if you want to think
about it that way.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.970
So if we think about
all that, and what

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.980
we know from stress and
coping literature in general,

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.850
and then try to apply it
to individuals with autism

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.730
and supporting their
families, I think

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.480
there are some things
we can ask ourselves

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.710
about how we can best
facilitate coping in families

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.870
of individuals with autism.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:45.140
One is to teach what the coping
literature calls instrumental

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.620
coping strategies--

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.650
things that make an actual
difference in the environment.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.830
It would probably
help if we got them

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.408
to toilet train their child.

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:54.950
If we could help
them get their child

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.510
to sleep through the night.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.910
If we could get them to eat
more than two foods, right.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.400
Those are instrumental
coping strategies.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.640
Those are things that change the
environment on a daily basis.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.940
And it might also help to
foster what's called palliative

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:14.870
coping strategies, things
that make you feel better,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.720
even if they're not
making a direct impact

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.430
on the environment.

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:23.270
Maybe they would be helped
by joining an autism cause

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.970
or serving as an autism
ambassador in the month

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.010
of April, for example.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.510
Or helping in some other
way with the school program

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.160
their child's involved with.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.340
So we could also look at
encouraging a commitment

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.660
to advocacy, because that would
fall into that realm as well.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:45.380
We've got to be focused on
and mindful of the potential

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.370
for burnout, looking for ways
to facilitate connections

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.870
to prevent burnout.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.450
To understand the
signs of burnout,

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.610
but maybe the most
important thing

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.500
would be that
perceived availability

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.080
piece we spoke about a few
minutes ago, because I have

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.370
a feeling that that might
be us in their answer

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.700
to that question.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.290
You know, I have someone I
could talk to about my son's

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.670
behavioral challenges.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.350
I have someone I
could talk to about

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.372
my worries for their future.

00:13:15.372 --> 00:13:17.330
And I think that that's
really important for us

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.650
to keep in mind in terms of
looking at the broad spectrum

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.530
of the family's needs.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.730
Parent training is the
quintessential instrumental

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.870
coping skill, and something
that we have decades of research

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.490
supporting and
indicating just how

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.860
powerful a technology that is.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.620
And we know that it not
only teaches skills,

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.060
but it actually
does reduce stress.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.780
And we know that
from the literature.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.910
What's the best way
to train parents?

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:52.100
We have a lot, a
lot of information

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.670
that supports BST kind of
model with modeling rehearsal

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.450
and feedback with real
world skill training.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.570
But one of the things for us, I
think, to think about and maybe

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.810
work toward in this context
of compassionate care

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.710
is a little more thought about
how we explain parental non

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.820
adherence.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.660
One of my favorite articles
is from the year 2000.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.690
It was Alan and Warzac's article
on parental non adherence,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.030
and it's a behavior
analytic formulation

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.990
of why parents aren't
doing what we have

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.060
instructed them to do, right.

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.310
It's kind of a
functional assessment

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.800
of that kind of noncompliance
or non adherence,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.090
which I think we don't
think about enough.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.100
And they, kind of,
outline, hey, you

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.590
know there are some major
reasons why this might not

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:43.070
happen, because we aren't
matching our interventions

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.470
to what's important
to these families.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.980
Or we are creating 47
step behavior plans

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.160
that you can't do while
you're also making dinner.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.360
Or we're not focusing on just
how punishing the consequences

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.220
are in a community
meltdown, and why

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.080
it's not going to be followed
through on in that context.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.980
And I think it's a really
brilliant article that kind of

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:11.320
foreshadowed and set us up
for a conversation about how

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.490
we should deliver skills
compassionately to families

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.690
of individuals on the spectrum.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.460
And I guess that one of
the ways I think about this

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.470
is by bringing in
some of what I think

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.600
about social skills
training in general,

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.360
which is the issue of
perspective taking, right.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.810
To what extent are we
really putting ourselves

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.330
in the shoes of families
that we work with,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.750
and considering some of the
ways in which our interventions

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.870
might not align with
their life situations.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.300
And why they're
real world dilemmas

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.290
prevent them from adhering
to the recommendations that

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.010
have been made in that context.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.290


00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.059
In terms of strategies
for maintaining skills,

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.500
we know that skills are more
likely to be maintained,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.390
including in parent
training contexts,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.590
if we provide for ongoing
maintenance, support, feedback,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.760
check-ins.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.620
So that's another
area I think for us

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.720
to do a little bit
of self-examination

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.290
in terms of the extent to which
we're actually doing that.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.870


00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.470
And we have to
broaden our definition

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
of how we're evaluating our
own success in these contexts.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.380
So maybe we're looking at
whether the parent can perform

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.380
the behavior, whether we've
taught it to them in that BST

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.350
model, but we need
to be also looking

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.940
at whether it's
creating improvements

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.840
in the behavior of the child.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.990
We need to be looking at
generalization, especially

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.790
to the natural
environment, and we

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.340
need to be looking at
maintenance over time

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.000
and whether parents need
additional supports in order

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.840
to be able to continue to
intervene in those ways.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.300
And I guess in setting us
up for the rest of today,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.240
I want to just ask
ourselves, too,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.940
do we find ourselves
judging parents?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.600
I hear a lot of
judgmental statements

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.600
about parents among clinicians.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.900
And some of that is
venting, and I get that.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.150
That's a form of social support.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.820
We need to have an avenue
for expression, even

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.300
among ourselves.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.910
But I think it's
important for us

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.660
to look at this, especially
from a teaching, training,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.580
and supervision perspective.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.320
I think it's really
important for us

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.050
to widen the lens a little bit,
in terms of professionalism

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.110
skills, in what we're
teaching and training

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.200
others about the
attributions we are making,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.860
about parental behavior, about
the assessments we're doing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
of parental non adherence, and
about the extent to which we're

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.290
truly compassionately
delivering support and care

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.340
to the families that we serve.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.880


00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.780
So, given all of that,
what are the implications?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.930
What should we prioritize in
working with parents of people

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.139
with autism spectrum disorders?

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.900
I think we need to think
more about a person centered

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.930
approach in this context
and ask ourselves,

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.400
what are their priorities?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.950
What are the things they're
motivated to work on?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.510
What will work in their lives?

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.470
Create plans that
are implementable

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.470
in those settings, think
about the supports that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.770
need to be put in place in
order for there to be success

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.100
in that context,
and really examine

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.270
how we're perceiving
a lack of success.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.960
We don't blame the
learners in the context

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.700
of the individual with autism.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.350
We say the learner
is always right.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.290
We say they didn't fail to
learn, we failed to teach.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.140
And we need to think about that
and see that in the same way

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.660
when we struggle with the
families of individuals

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.310
that we serve.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.480
And so in the context
of what I presented

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.140
about stress and about the
stress literature in general,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.610
now I want you to think about
how that does apply to families

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.890
who have individuals
with autism within them,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.860
because it does mean a
different kind of life.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.600
It does mean powerful
negative emotions at times.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.970
It also has a lot
of positive sides.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.820
I really love looking at
the sibling literature

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.580
for individuals with autism.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.370
Their siblings
really are incredibly

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.690
compassionate, tolerant,
strong, resilient people.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.540
A huge majority of them, we
now have data to support this,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.185
we've said this
anecdotally for years,

00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:45.560
but we now have data that
shows a huge percentage of them

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.160
go into helping professions,
feel a sense of mission

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.510
about helping others.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.030


00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.300
Having an individual with
autism in your family really

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.750
has a lot of benefit
for the world in terms

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.600
of who you become and
what you're likely to do

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.910
with your life and your energy.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.570
And that's true for families
in general and parents, too.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.550
Many of them, in
addition to talking

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.760
about the stress, and the
depression, and anxiety,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.399
and the worry, and the
financial difficulties,

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.899
also talk about strength,
resilience, family bonding,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.960
a sense of meaning,
involvement and advocacy,

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.490
a new definition to their life.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.730
And so it's important
when we talk about this

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.010
because I feel like we're
always at risk for this

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.080
being a little bit
of a bummer, in terms

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.750
of all the negative
impact that this can have.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.080
It's also important to talk
about the positive effects

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.990
because they're also
part of the story.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.330
And I think to have a
balanced perspective

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.120
on it is really important.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.090
Every family has a story,
and all of their journeys

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.770
are going to be
completely unique.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.160
One of the things that
I've found really profound

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.500
is listening to and learning
from parents of individuals

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.730
on the spectrum who have
spoken about those experiences.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.160
So a number of years
ago, Mary Beth Walsh

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.950
talked at the ABAI
autism conference,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.590
and Shannon Penrod
spoke there recently.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.000
And there's been a lecture
circuit of several individuals

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.760
from Little Star in
Indiana, including

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.190
Mary Rosswurm, who's
been doing a talk

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.320
on A Mile in My Moccasins.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.790
I think that we all need to hear
much more often and much more

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.000
regularly from
families telling us

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.950
about the uniqueness
of their journeys

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.990
and informing us
about the things

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.530
we do that help and the
things we do that do not help.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.740
And I think it also
reminds us of some

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.070
of those positive impact
and positive outcomes

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.780
that they also share,
and note, and attribute

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.420
to their experiences.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.050


00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.900
We talked a little bit
about this already,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.830
in terms of the sense of mission
and other positive impacts.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.310
I think that in summing up
this portion of the talk,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.650
before we move into
compassionate skills,

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.300
what I want us to think about
is that the stress that's

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.950
inherent in having a family
member with autism is severe,

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.030
and it is unique.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.780
And it meets the
definition of every element

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.090
of stressor in the
stress literature

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.400
that you can possibly find.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.250
Every single article
or conceptualization

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.820
of stress that you find, if you
filter autism through there,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.420
you conclude this is really
a high intensity stressor.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.380
This is one that's going to take
a tremendous amount of coping

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.410
resources.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.830
This is one that's going
to require expertise

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.440
on the part of providers
to serve not just

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.690
the complex needs
of this individual,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.150
but the very, very
significant needs

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.410
of every member of the family.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.857
And we know, from the stress
literature, what helps.

00:06:55.857 --> 00:06:57.690
We know that families
are going to be helped

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.370
by support, especially that
perceived availability issue,

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.400
and especially knowing
others in similar situations.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.400
We know that they're going to be
helped with skill development,

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.950
with real world changes
in their daily lives.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.050
And we know how to do that with
behavioral skills training.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.640
And we know that
we have to build

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.170
their sense of control, their
impact on their environment.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.670
And we know that
they're going to be

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.238
helped by advocacy and
involvement on a broad level.

00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:30.030
And we know that they're
going to be helped

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.030
if we can convey
compassion, if the service

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:37.890
providers in their life
behave toward them in a manner

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.590
that we would define as
consistent with compassion.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.460
And so now I'm going to shift
us a little bit into talking

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.470
about what does that mean?

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.510
Because it's aspirational.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.300
It's important from an
aspirational perspective,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:52.920
but we, as behavior
analysts, need

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.180
to get that to a concrete level,
to an operational definition.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.310


00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.350
So the first step is
to define compassion.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.460
So I started with the
dictionary, which is always

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.920
a good place to start.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.830
Merriam-Wester says it's
sympathetic consciousness

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.180
of others' distress together
with a desire to alleviate it.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.630
And it refers to both an
understanding of another's pain

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.090
and the desire to somehow
mitigate that pain.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.730
If you look up
related words, you

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.470
get lists like this,
mercy, empathy, tenderness,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:42.860
benevolence, kindness, clemency,
consideration, et cetera.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.350
And you find that the
absence of compassion

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.180
is defined as mercilessness
or indifference.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.862
And that makes sense,
definitionally,

00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:53.570
that makes sense.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.920
It's still a bit undefined
from an ABA perspective,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.110
from an operational
definition perspective,

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.410
but it makes sense in terms
of the components of it.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.050
And if you look at or think
about who needs compassion,

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.990
when does it become important
for us, as a society,

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:16.850
to think about compassion
as an outcome in care?

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.270
We generally think about
people who are in pain,

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.740
people who are suffering, people
who are in need objectively

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.360
of assistance.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.830
Those are categories
we would broadly

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.400
think about in
terms of who needs

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.300
us to behave with compassion.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.230
And if you look more
further into this,

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.760
you find that when people are
offered compassion, people

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.790
who are in need, who are in
pain, or who are suffering,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.980
when they're offered
compassionate care,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.840
they feel validated.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.550
They feel understood.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:51.260
They feel supported.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.170
They would indicate
they've been helped.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.030
And those seem like
outcomes we very much

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:01.560
would want with the families
of individuals that we serve.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.400
And so now I want to take us
a little bit more of a bridge

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.600
into our world of ABA and ABA
intervention for individuals

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.370
on the spectrum.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.710
And I think there's
a couple of ways

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.460
that make the argument really
compelling for me about why

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.890
it's important for us
to broaden our lens,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.020
to include compassionate
care skill development.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.610
And one of them is the outcomes
because we're much more

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.240
likely to have better
outcomes with the individuals

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.693
that we serve directly, the
individuals with autism,

00:10:31.693 --> 00:10:33.110
and we're much
more likely to have

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.540
better outcomes for
the family members

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.230
if we can achieve
compassionate care.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:42.320
And outcomes are
what we're all about.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.780
We're always about
maximizing outcomes,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.910
having the biggest
impact we can possibly

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.280
have for the learners
that were involved with.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.350
We're also more likely to have
positive family functioning,

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.440
for the individuals
in their families

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.950
to all be functioning with fewer
negative effects of stress.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.240
It might be that it would
help us from a PR perspective.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.750
I hear a lot of people
talking about our difficulties

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:15.680
in PR, our impressions of being
a bit cold, a bit mechanistic,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.130
a bit lacking in
heart, whether or not

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.610
we think that's
appropriate or fair,

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:25.100
it is what some
people think and say

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.325
about the community
of behavior analysts.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:28.700
So it's important
for us to think

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.545
about that in that context.

00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:33.290


00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.440
I think it's also important
from an ethical mandate

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.320
and responsibility, our
obligations to those

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.500
we serve include the family
members of the individuals

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.770
we serve.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.920
And I think it's
really consistent

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.380
with a super fundamental core
element of service provision,

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.260
which is humane care.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.620
And I think it's highly
consistent with all

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.000
of these goals.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.320
So then, what are the skills?

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.250
What are we talking about?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.510
What's the operational
definition?

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.260
We can look at that
dictionary definition,

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.995
and we can say,
"Yeah, that's it."

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:13.370
But I don't think
that that would

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.850
help us know whether
so-and-so is demonstrating it,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.610
so-and-so is not
demonstrating it.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.420
Can we measure it?

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:23.330
Could we give people
performance based feedback

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.790
on that dictionary
definition, or do we

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.990
need to take it to a different
level of meticulous definition

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.840
and description?

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.320
So there's not a
tremendous amount

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.330
of literature in
behavior analysis,

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.230
you might have noticed, on
compassionate care skills.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.200
I do think we've got that
consensus and convergence

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:45.872
building.

00:12:45.872 --> 00:12:47.330
And we're starting
to see articles,

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.913
and I bet we're going to see a
whole lot more in the next five

00:12:49.913 --> 00:12:50.960
years.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.552
But I decided to look
outside of behavior analysis

00:12:55.552 --> 00:12:57.260
and see well, what
are other people doing

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.080
about defining, measuring,
and training people in this?

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.300
Because we can always
learn from allied

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.190
disciplines, and we're not
that good at that, either,

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:07.860
in behavior analysis.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.310
And we have so
much more we could

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.040
learn from allied professions.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.660
And so I think it's
important for us

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.070
to look at it from that
perspective as well.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.390
So I want to look at
what I see evolving

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.780
in the medical community.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.410
So, in the medical community,
in medicine and nursing,

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.070
you could find tremendous
numbers of resource on this.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.070
They know this is
related to outcomes.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.010
They know this is related
to patient satisfaction.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.980
They know this is related to how
the public perceives medicine

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.270
and nursing.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.590
And they're pretty motivated
to increase these skills

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.340
in medical and nursing students.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.350
And they also note
that in addition

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:48.630
to being linked to
patient satisfaction,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.620
it's linked to their adherence
to whatever medical protocol

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.110
they are instructing
them to follow,

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.560
that it's linked to their
comprehension of what

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.080
and why they need to do.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.300
And it's linked to
their perception

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.890
of a good interpersonal
relationship

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.810
with their provider.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.590
They have found and shown that
it leads to improved patient

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.180
medical outcomes.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.720
And they've found and shown that
it reduces malpractice risk.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.070
There are fewer
problems legally when

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.310
patients feel that they've been
delivered care with compassion.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.350


00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.920
And they have also
acknowledged that they

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.430
have a pre-existing
problem with the delivery

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.100
of compassionate care skills.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.720
In some studies,
they've just looked

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.870
at to what extent
are people exhibiting

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
the kinds of responses we
consider to be best practice.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.700
In one study, they
found only 21%

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.870
responded with appropriately
to emotional content

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.580
that was offered by the
individual in their care.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.820
And they also found that
70% of opportunities

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
for compassionate care responses
were missed in first oncology

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.210
visits.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.110
Not a good time to miss empathic
responding opportunities.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.010
These people are at the
lowest points in their lives.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.050
And other issues.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.590
They found that
physicians were very

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.250
likely to interrupt patients.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.640
I think that might be a shared
problem in our discipline too.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.500
And that they failed to allow
the patient opportunity, time

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
to convey their concerns,
to fully articulate

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.810
their questions.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.520
One of my favorite articles is
by Bonvicini and colleagues.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.070
And it was published in 2009.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.160
They looked at three kinds of
opportunities that presented

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.040
routinely in medical visits.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.440
They looked at
statements of progress,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.020
challenges to the physician,
and emotional responding--

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.610
expressions of emotion,
frustration, anger, et cetera.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.660
And this is probably
a little hard to see.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.500
But what I liked about
this, even though it's not

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.750
exactly the way we
would approach it,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.890
is they were making
real attempts to code

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.010
the kinds of responses people
would make in these situations.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.760
For example, looking at an
emotional feeling statement,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.980
a progress statement, and
a challenge statement,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.290
they defined those,
what the patient would

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.090
be doing in order
for us to consider

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.640
this kind of opportunity.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.070
And they coded
response categories

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.890
with a variety of different
categories of confirmation,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.490
validation, et cetera,
acknowledging the statement

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.790
without pursuit, with pursuit,
confirming, or really moving

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.880
into what they called a
shared feeling or experience

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.180
where there was really an
interpersonal connection.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.780
Again, not what we would
consider behavior analytically

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.590
sound, but a real
attempt to codify

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.320
and to distinguish
the kinds of behavior

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.370
that physicians were exhibiting.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.280
And they also looked
at global ratings.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.790
And their global outcome
ratings that they looked at

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.650
were connecting with
the patient as a person,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.130
being empathic with the patient,
and inviting the patient

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.930
to share their understanding,
perspective, and feelings.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.300
Now, probably something
that requires a lot more

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.380
work on our part in terms of
nuts-and-bolts definitions

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.790
of components skills.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.700
But still, from an aspirational
perspective, a really nice

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.720
beginning in terms of that.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.980
And what was the
training they did?

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.830
So these people did
six-hour workshops

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.550
with didactic material
presented in practice sessions

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.640
where they engaged in four key
clinician-patient communication

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.930
skills-- engaging, educating,
empathizing, and enlisting.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.400
And they also talked about
codifying choices and changes

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.320
that the individual
needed to make

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.710
and looking at how they managed
difficult relationships.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.560
But two things that I thought
were kind of interesting

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
is each workshop was followed
up with individualized coaching

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.930
sessions of 45
minutes where they

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.920
worked on components skills
for each of those individuals.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.110
And each workshop
was also followed

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.380
by a review of taped
interactions of each workshop

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.580
participant with a real patient.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.480
So they were provided with
performance-based feedback

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.470
about all of those elements
they had been trained on

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.149
with a real live
patient interaction.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.519
And they showed
changes pre and post.

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.660
Again, it wouldn't be
the way we would do it.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.930
But they did show
changes pre and post.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.190
And they did six months
of post-training follow-up

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.860
and indicated
maintenance of the skills

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.680
with real-world
interactions with clients.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.520
So I think there's things
for us to be learned.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.110
The medical and
nursing communities,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.230
that happens to be my favorite
of the ones I found there.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.520
But there are more.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.120
They've done a fair
amount of work,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.740
especially in training medical
students and nursing students

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.280
as well as practicing
practitioners.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.580
And other disciplines similarly
look at these outcomes,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.510
look at these issues,
and work hard to train

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.450
students and practitioners of
their fields in those areas.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.130
Psychology, social work,
counseling are just a few

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.750
where it's prominently
included in their literature.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.520
And in counseling
and psychology,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.800
you see lots of
different threads of it.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.010
So going way back,
decades and decades,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.800
the humanitarian
psychology movement,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.460
unconditional positive regard
skills, literally going back

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.410
to the days of Carl
Rogers, this has

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:36.820
been a main thrust of patient
care in terms of psychology.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.100
The positive psychology movement
uses a lot of these skills

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.270
as well.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.980
There are newer kinds
of approaches, including

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.930
compassion-centric counseling.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.370
And there's a lot of focus.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.900
Especially in
psychology, you can

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.000
find many, many, many resources
on things like self-compassion,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.720
how to, as a therapist,
engage in self-compassion

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.230
and how to teach clients to
engage in self-compassion so

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.090
that there's less judgment
and more understanding.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.840
And a lot of conversation
also about compassion

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.690
fatigue and how that's
something that can affect us

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.170
as service providers.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.600
But it can also
affect people who

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.950
are in caregiving roles and
educating people about that

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.050
and preventing burnout
in that context.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.610
They're all interesting
and, while a bit far

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.250
afield from what we're
doing, relevant in certain

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.510
ways to define the skill
set we're talking about.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.500
Social work has been talking
about compassionate competence.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.380
So they say, an ethically
successful integration

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.660
and transformation of knowledge,
skills, attitudes, behaviors,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.970
and policies to sympathetically
and consciously alleviate

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.980
suffering.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.920
So what do we know from ABA?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.805
There have been several seminal
articles in the last few years

00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:01.930
that I think are incredibly
instructive and helpful

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.830
in moving us all into this area.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.300
And they're really focused
on getting us beyond empathy,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.440
beyond understanding.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440
Now, that's important.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.520
I think that's a component
of the larger composite.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.050
But I think it's
only a component.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.660
We have to have more than
empathy, more than empathetic

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.680
responding.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.830
We have to have something that
moves us more into the ability

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.550
to alleviate suffering and that
would have some social validity

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.300
measures attached to it of
people's experiences of us

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:35.830
in that context.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.910
So two articles
that I really like--

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.100
Gould, Tarbox,
and Coyne in 2017.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.300
And it's not just Taylor.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.720
It's Taylor, LeBlanc,
and Nosik in 2018.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.300
Those two articles, I think,
are kind of really helping

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.800
us move us into this path
and get us to the point

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.770
where we could develop some
operational definitions

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.230
and some instructional
approaches that

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.480
could be developing.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.680
Gould, Tarbox, and
Coyne talked about how

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.830
reducing parental
stress over time

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.050
requires a number
of different skills.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.390
It might include helping
parents realign goals.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.360
It might be helping
the parent who

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.490
we might, in a moment of
venting and frustration,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.650
describe as unrealistic.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.490
But they might need assistance
in actually realigning

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.679
their definition
of realistic goals,

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.320
in letting go of some
of the other goals

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.400
that maybe they had
envisioned, and realizing

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.200
a path that's better
suited to the individual.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.610
They might need help
developing self-care skills

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.910
and understanding that, in
order to do the marathon,

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.700
you're going to have to
attend to your own needs

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.280
because you can't go
at the sprint pace

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.140
without consequences.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.242
And they might need
assistance too.

00:09:00.242 --> 00:09:01.950
I think one thing
we're probably good at,

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.560
baseline good at, is helping
parents acknowledge gains

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.340
that the individual is making
so that their perspective can

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.760
include realistically seeing
the progress that is being made,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.960
that the child is making.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.660
Taylor et al really
advance us further

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.840
toward defining
compassionate care and what

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.930
the components of compassionate
care skills might be.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.920
And they link it to a
number of other ways

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.600
that we talk about emotional
and social skill development.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.880
And it is relevant
in that context

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.860
where they talk about,
well, it requires

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.340
a combination of perspective
taking and tacting

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:43.960
when others are suffering.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.630
In other words, I think
about it-- in ethics,

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.490
when I teach and train
ethics, I think about

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:52.150
signal detection as one of
the first component skills.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:55.690
Do you even know you're
in an ethical problem?

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.160
That's a
signal-detection problem

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.910
as Wayne Fuqua has told
us in the ethics world.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.270
That's important here too.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.720
Am I in an opportunity here?

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.360
Does this person need
an empathic response?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.540
Do I need to think about
this as an opportunity

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.060
for demonstrating
compassion in this context?

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.170
So I think that the perspective
taking and the ability

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.200
to tact in those experiences
and those we serve

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.100
are important in that
particular outcome.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.690
It's also important--
and you see

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.620
a lot of this emerging in
the parallel literature

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.310
we have on cultural sensitivity
and diversity training

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.720
within behavior analysis.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.910
We have to get a little better
at evaluating ourselves--

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.130
our own skill sets,
our own biases,

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.455
our own sources of
frustration, our own strengths,

00:10:42.455 --> 00:10:43.990
our own weaknesses.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.140
And I think that that's
relevant here as well.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.830
Tacting our own experiences,
tacting our reactions

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.190
to what a family might be
presenting at the moment,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.030
I think that could be
important for us going forward

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.690
in helping individuals
develop this skill set.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.320
Observing how the suffering
of the person we're with

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.670
might be related to our own
and acting more intentionally

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.010
toward alleviating the
suffering of the caregiver.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.430
I think that that's
something that, probably

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.780
in behavior analysis, doesn't
happen as naturally as it does,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.630
say, in clinical
psychology but might

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:28.810
be important in terms
of delivering compassion

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.940
to individuals we serve.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.060
Taylor, LeBlanc, and
Nosik also linked it

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.410
to a few other things that
are happening in our field

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.900
and getting a lot of attention,
including RFT and ACT

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.570
and particularly in terms of how
it involves perspective taking

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.340
and a real focus on
the I-you frame, really

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.600
understand the reciprocity and
the differential experience

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.385
in the parties being served.

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.890


00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.150
So what are some of the
skills that they found.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.740
So they did a survey
of parents in terms

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.990
of getting some
information about what

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.240
behavior analysts
were doing well

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.800
and behavior analysts
were not doing well.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.340
And I think it's interesting
because it gives us

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.960
some initial targets from an
instructions and skill-building

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.130
perspective.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.910
And I think that it also
has a lot of face validity.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:30.790
If you look at this and you see
the things that they indicate

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.450
maybe are areas in
need for us in teaching

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.660
training and supervising,
especially more junior behavior

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.380
analysts, I think that
it resonates in terms

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.660
of some of the shared deficits.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:46.780
So some of the things
that were noted

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.420
in that article
as potential areas

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.890
for us to improve, to do
better, to develop methods

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.200
for teaching and training.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.990
Compromising during
a disagreement.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.893
That's a big one.

00:12:59.893 --> 00:13:01.810
I've been doing a lot
of work, both clinically

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.310
and from a research
perspective in

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.560
interdisciplinary
collaboration, as I

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.850
mentioned over the past year.

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.750
And this is the big one.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.190
This is a big one in terms of
how people from other fields

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.660
rate us in terms of
difficult collaborators,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.080
our ability to work through
different points of view

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.080
and areas of disagreement.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.430
Inquiring about their
satisfaction and role

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.980
clarification.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.870
That makes sense.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.800
In empathy and compassion,
the areas to improve,

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:41.170
areas where families report not
feeling that well supported,

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.680
not seeing as frequently
present in their interactions,

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.730
include demonstrating and
caring about the entire family.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.950
That's that laser
focus I started with.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.270
There is so much to talk
about about this kid.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.260
And that's what we go
in ready to talk about.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:59.020
We have our whole
list of what we

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.480
need to focus in on from a
challenging behavior and skill

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.960
deficit perspectives.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.500
But the family is looking for
us to check in with them more

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.240
broadly and will help them
adapt and cope and flourished

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.170
between visits if we can do so.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.020
Acknowledging mistakes
or treatment failures.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.940
Again, something that maybe we
don't do enough from a teaching

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.950
and training perspective.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.040
Are we actually teaching
behavior analysts

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.520
how to do that?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.150
And we need to
because they're going

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.290
to be in a professional
service provision role

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.080
where mistakes will be made.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.890
Being patient and
being reassuring.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.630
I look at that and
I think soft skills.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:45.640
Those are the soft skills that
we're not spending as much time

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.490
in our teaching and training
of behavior analysts doing.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.910


00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.000
Items that may
contribute to problems.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.250
The ones that are bolded
here were the ones that

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.050
came up as most significant.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.440
Seems to have his or her own
agenda about the direction

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.840
of my child's program.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.660
That's a problem in
reciprocity, in conversation.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.830
Are we working on the things the
family most wants to work on?

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.830
Are we hearing what parents
are telling us about that?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.040
Underestimates my
child's ability.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.160
And, maybe the worst one,
the most damning sentence,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.350
I feel like, up here is
one of the bolded ones.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.770
Has an authoritarian demeanor
rather than a collaborative one

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.030
when discussing decisions
about my child's program.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.000
That's a PR problem right there.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400
And that's important
because this is feedback.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.900
Right?

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.130
We are the feedback junkies,
and they have told us

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.290
that these are some of their
experiences in getting services

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.420
from our profession
that we want to think

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.959
about changing, that we want
to focus on instructionally.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.630
And so how do we
teach these skills?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.350
So number one, I think one
of the things we need to do

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.380
is talk about these
skills, expand the lens,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.750
educate others about
the importance of these,

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.300
talk about their
relationship to outcomes,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.170
talk about how they're part of
the solution to the PR problem

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.760
that we seem to have.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.090
And we need to work toward
an operational definition

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.590
of these target skills.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.880
Because this is good.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.500
I feel like the
whole talk, we're

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.760
getting a little narrower.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.940
We're going from this big lands
and we're funneling it down.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.142
But we're not quite
there yet in terms

00:01:39.142 --> 00:01:41.350
of what's the operational
definition of these skills.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.620
What am I going to teach my
students in my collaboration

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.080
class so that their
survey results don't

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.000
look like the ones I presented?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.770
That's the question.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.600
Right?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.150
And we need to actively
teach those skills

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.830
with evidence-based practices.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.190
I mean, I think we do.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.520
I think we should be using
behavior skills training.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.062
We should be using
the things that we

00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:04.600
to know to work across
multiple populations

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.650
and multiple skills, and we
need to apply that technology

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.440
to this new set of skills.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.650
I think we really need to
expand it into coursework.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.400
I always see that as
part of the solution,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.770
probably because I spend
so much of my life teaching

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.410
and training behavior analysis.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.470
At Endicott, we have a required
course in collaboration.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.950
I'm really proud of that.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.100
I don't think that
many programs do.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.720
But I think more
and more of us need

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.910
to find ways to integrate
that skill set into courses so

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.830
that it's becoming part
of the conversation

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.600
very early in people's careers.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
And I think we need to
be giving people feedback

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.330
on this in courses,
in supervision, in job

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.560
performance, about the extent
to which they are performing

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.300
the target skills.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.360
And I think that
it's really important

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.890
to think about this from the
context of the consequences

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.340
that exist for us in the absence
of progress in this area.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.450
So I think about,
for example, what

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.450
we're talking about here
is relationship building

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.130
versus relationship erosion.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.370


00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.370
Early in my career, one
of the lessons I learned,

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.040
one of the frames I keep
in my head all the time

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.920
and I carry around with me in
clinical contexts with kids

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.130
with autism is something I
learned from my colleagues

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.520
in the fluency world
of intervention.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.920
Carl Binder talked about
being a fluency builder

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.640
not a fluency blocker.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.530
And I learned so many strategies
from my colleagues in that area

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.290
that I think about all the
time about how I can free up

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.270
those responses, how I
can make sure I'm not

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.100
imposing artificial ceilings.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.610
And I feel like this has taken
on a similar kind of space

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.880
in my head, which is we need to
be thinking about relationship

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.890
building and not
relationship erosion.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.330
So what am I doing here that's
as Stephen Covey would say,

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.010
putting deposits in
the emotional bank

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.040
account versus
making withdrawals

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.390
from the emotional bank account?

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.970
I think that's really
important, in terms

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.380
of having a frame that helps
us understand the importance

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.440
and relevance of this
across our interactions.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250
And I think it might
help us to frame things

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.060
with empathy versus anger, to
really build self-awareness

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.550
and tacting skills
and to build some

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.420
of what's been talked about as
those self-compassion skills.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.920
So what are the components of
poor self-compassionate care?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.630
If you look at that literature
in counseling and psychology,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.470
negative self-assessment,
a disproportionate focus

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.200
on routine errors
that you might make,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.120
self-critical verbal behavior.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.820
Those are probably
not good outcomes

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.200
that we want to see either.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.960
That's not setting
the individual up well

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.510
to acknowledge their own
mistakes in ways that help

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.080
them improve and do better.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.810
Other barriers that we
need to be focused on

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.970
include stressors at
work, stressors at home,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.880
general burnout,
poor coping skills.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.830


00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.480
And now I want to talk about
the components themselves.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.020
What are the behaviors?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.480
What are the soft skills?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.980
How would I measure them?

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.610
How would I tell someone you
did it or you didn't do it?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.650
So if you look at some of the
sources that exist out there,

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.150
there are a number of
people who have done this

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.750
and we can borrow from,
think about things

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.310
we might want to add to it.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.940
But Riess and Kraft-Todd
have an EMPATHY list

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.500
that goes by those letters.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.450
Eye contact, Muscles, Posture,
Affect, Tone of voice,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.750
Hearing the whole patient,
and what Your response

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.700
is to what they say.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.620
At Trumpet, published in the
article in Taylor, LeBlanc,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.320
and Nozick, they
actually published

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.110
some of the tools they
use at Trumpet Behavioral

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.820
Health for assessing
and repairing

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.520
therapeutic relationships.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.970
They focus on strategies for
improving trust and rapport,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.590
which include reflecting and
avoiding passing judgment,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.080
interruptions, blame,
trigger words, jargon,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.750
an authoritarian
demeanor; whether they're

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.470
good at identifying a
damaged relationship;

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.620
whether they're good at
that signal detection skill

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.502
we talked about--

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:27.960
do you recognize
there's a problem?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.320
Do you apologize for
it in the moment?

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.770
How are you doing at
assessing the relationship?

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.070
How are you managing
planned and unexpected

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.930
difficult conversations?

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.200
And what's your
capacity for reflection

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.850
and perspective-taking?

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.650
In the same article,
they also talked

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.540
about some of the
strategies that they

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.060
use at Alpine
Learning Group, where

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.190
they look at positive
social interactions.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.070
So a couple that I
pulled from there.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.280
They look at eye
contact, appreciation,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.750
asking the parent how they
are, avoiding flat affect,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.120
negative comments
about the child.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.590
They also look at empathy--

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.050
open-ended questions,
verifications

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.930
of the individual's
feeling, avoiding

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.310
being distracted and jumping
too quickly off topic.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.430
Compassion, including
pauses, including

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.100
supportive statements,
giving people a chance

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.500
to participate in the other
end of the conversation

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.350
so that it can actually
be a reciprocal process.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.880
Collaboration includes seeking
the parents ideas and approval

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.300
of the path you're thinking
about pursuing from a treatment

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.240
perspective and
acknowledging mistakes.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.910
There is a number
of things going on

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.260
in the field that have
relevance, as I mentioned,

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.270
especially from an
ACT perspective.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.460
Teaching self-compassion
to parents

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.010
of individuals with
autism has been

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.520
emphasized by a lot of
the folks doing ACT.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.580
And developing procedures
to teach interventionists

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.460
to develop rapport with
young children with autism

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.760
might be expanded and changed in
terms of the focus of building

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.080
rapport with their families.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.620
We want to be using
evidence-based procedures

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.160
to do this.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.620
And we need more people
doing this kind of work

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.720
from a research
perspective to outline

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.940
some effective methods for us.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:22.020
I think we do need to embed
it into the coursework

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.620
so that we're emphasizing
parental experience so

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.110
that people
understand the stress

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.900
and coping aspects that
I started the talk with,

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.830
so people understand impact
of the experience of parenting

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.510
a child with autism.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.490
I think it's helpful
to have a collaboration

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.799
class or a set of
collaboration skills built

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.260
into existing classes.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.590
And we need to focus on
skill-building, in terms of how

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.420
do we teach those soft skills.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.310
I think we need to embed
it into supervision.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.000
And I think the only way to
do that, aside from developing

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.630
rubrics, is to observe people's
interactions with families.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.450
Not just observe them doing a
preference assessment or an FA

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.260
with the kid, but observe them
interacting with the families

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.900
in difficult conversations.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.550
Observe them
interacting with members

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.180
of the interdisciplinary team
to look at other collaborative

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.210
skill development.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.000
Nancy Marchese is going
into her final year

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.610
in the doctoral program
at Endicott College,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:24.060
and she has taken this
on as her dissertation.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.690
And she's working on
developing a rubric that

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.990
could be used to give
performance-based feedback

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.080
to individuals about
their interactions

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.452
with family members.

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:37.410
And some of the targets
that she has up there--

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:41.280
and I'd be happy to share
this with all of you

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.380
who wanted to follow
up with me on email,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.180
to give you more
specific information

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.622
on the entire document.

00:09:47.622 --> 00:09:49.080
But you can see
that she's embedded

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.760
some of these things
that have come out

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.370
of the literature
from other fields

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.560
and from the
articles we reviewed

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.880
about parental experience
within ABA service providers.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.380
And so she's looking at some
of those open-ended questions,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.170
appropriate nonverbal behavior,
supportive statements,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.510
pausing, giving
people an opportunity

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.470
to speak, whether they're
able to summarize information

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:19.270
in ways that check for the
validity of their impression

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:23.050
of the parent's
perspective, and offering

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.330
support and partnership.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.270
So she's in the middle of
kind of piloting and exploring

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.690
how this could be used to
teach and train these skills

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.760
and then to provide
performance-based feedback

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.830
to individuals about
the extent to which they

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.490
exhibited those target skills.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.730
In our broader research
lab, our focus this year

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.040
has been on the development
of collaboration

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.410
within interdisciplinary
team contexts,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:55.240
which is related in that it
is also all about soft skills.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.000
And it's about helping
people understand

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.100
ways to exhibit behaviors that
lead to approach and reduce

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.185
avoidance.

00:11:04.185 --> 00:11:05.560
We don't want
people avoiding us.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.850
We want people approaching us.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.350
We don't want to offend people.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.620
But we need to get a
little bit specific

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.980
about what are the behaviors
that create approach

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.690
and what are the behaviors
that create avoidance

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.400
so that people can be more
successful in those contexts.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.820
So we've been looking at various
kinds of training approaches

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.370
and rubrics that
we can use to build

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.700
those soft skills, including
eye contact, the elements

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.660
of nondefensive
posture, et cetera,

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.990
and looking at things like--

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.600
this comes from our
interdisciplinary work--

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.120
were they able to acknowledge
the other person's

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.060
point of view in a
reflective statement?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.790
Did they give them the
opportunity to speak?

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.820
Did they ask some
follow-up questions

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.880
about why that person might be
suggesting that intervention?

00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:00.880
And did they validate something
about the interdisciplinary

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.360
collaborator or in this case the
parent's view of the behavior?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.864
So looking at some of
those skills as well.

00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:14.800
So when I think
about our task here,

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.710
I think we can ask ourselves
why should we do this.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.750
And I think about,
whether you're

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.850
talking about
interdisciplinary collaboration

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.180
and certainly if you're talking
about the support we provide

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.210
to family members of those
we serve, everyone has

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.730
a universal desire for
respect, for validation, to be

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.600
understood, to be
treated with care.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.080
And I think we want to make
sure that we're extending that

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.480
beyond the individual
with autism

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:48.760
but to the family members of
that person who they live with.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.490
We seek good impressions
from families.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.540
It really hurts not just
us individually as behavior

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.820
analysts, not just
the organizations

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.540
we work for, but us as a
field when people walk away

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:06.340
from interactions with behavior
analysts feeling misunderstood,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.210
not validated, possibly
even disrespected.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.290
And that's not an outcome
that we want to be prevalent.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.982
And I think it's
really imperative

00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:17.440
that we think about,
well, what are

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.880
the ways we could reduce that?

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.380
And I think the
ways we could reduce

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.600
that would be to ensure
that these skills are

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.350
intact and strong and
vibrant in practitioners

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.070
of behavior analysis.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.780
It will unquestionably lead
to better outcomes for those

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.480
we serve, and I think
it will unquestionably

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.180
lead to an improved
reputation for our field

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.380
if people see us as
capable of providing

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.210
those kinds of skills.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.470
The really good news in all of
this is that this is the time.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.360
We have good sources.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.980
We have good starts.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.260
We have convergence
and consensus.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.220
I think we really are embarking
on a whole new era in terms

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.760
of operationally
defining and being

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.910
able to bring to fruition the
development of these skills

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.040
in ways that would make socially
significant differences.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.100
So I hope you share
my enthusiasm.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.730
I'd be happy to share any
sources that I provided

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.020
or to follow up with any
of you after the talk.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.770
And I just want to
thank you for having me

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.728
and for your attention.

00:14:19.728 --> 00:14:23.040
