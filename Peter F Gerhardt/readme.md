00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400


00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.400
Hi.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.592
Hello.

00:00:04.592 --> 00:00:06.010
Hi.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.430
Contingencies, people, damn it.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.841


00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:12.340
Hi.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.270
I'm Dr. Peter Gerhardt.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.297
And I have a very
long title, Ethics,

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.630
Evidence-Based Practice, and
Socially Important Outcomes

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.020
in ASD, Using the Right
Intervention at the Right Time

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.530
in the Right Context,
which is an awful lot

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.050
to go through in an hour.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.870
Thankfully, I'm a New Yorker,
so I speak really quickly.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.040
So I think I'll get through it.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.830
But we'll see.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.760


00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.480
I'm going to start with what
are socially important outcomes

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.080
for adults with autism?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.530
Well if we look at where
we know we are today,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.160
Paul Shattuck 2012, they looked
at a comprehensive literature

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.230
review of everything over
the past 10 years in 2010.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.890
to see what we know about
adults and adult services.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.290
And they concluded that
the field of adult services

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.440
is underdeveloped. and can be
considered a field of inquiry

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.930
that's relatively uninformed.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.820
That's my field.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.650
Thank you very much.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.500
So for the work you're doing
with little kids and younger

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.670
kids, they then transition
into a field that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.139
has little consensus about
what effective intervention is,

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:23.930
has little consensus
about what programming

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.810
is, has little understanding
of applied behavior

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.330
analysis, which puts
all the more pressure

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.020
on people working in school
and school districts.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.180
They once asked John
Dillinger why he robbed banks.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
He said, because that's
where the money is.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.460
I'm the Executive Director of
a school for kids with autism.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.300
People said, well,
you work with adults.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.520
Why are you in a school?

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.200
I said, because that's
where the money is.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.500
Because I can do better
transition programming

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.150
which will help in the adult
world if I focus there.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.990
Getting somebody in the adult
system is often too late.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.030
Roux, out of the same,
actually, organization, 2015--

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.070
young adults with autism
have a difficult time

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.040
following high school for
almost any how outcome you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.270
can imagine--

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.330
working, continuing school,
living independently,

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.890
socializing, and participating
in the community,

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.950
and staying healthy and safe.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.070
So in almost every measure,
we're falling short.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.220
One thing you should know, if
you don't know this already,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.830
is that basically everything
in the adult system

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.530
is based on philosophy
and not science.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.220
It's based on
preferences and likes

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.930
and what's the latest
sort of movement.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.110
Residentially, the outcome
literature on group care

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.350
is scant.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.900
And current knowledge about
its effect on targeted outcomes

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.500
is mostly based on studies
with small, non-representative

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.590
samples and weak study
design lacking control groups

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.900
and standardized measures.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.506
And we're making decisions about
these people's whole lives.

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:07.880
Based upon the
fact that we think

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.680
this is the right thing to do.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.120
That presents a problem, right?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.840


00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.290
Well, let's look at what
makes someone an adult then.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.940
Well, some characteristics
of adulthood in the US

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.610
include employed
and able to maintain

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.000
personal needs, independence
across environments,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.850
able to make and
maintain friendships,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.400
able to make both simple and
complex choices recognize

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.080
and respond to
challenges to safety,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.990
maintain patience
and flexibility.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.031
That, actually, I'm very
good at I must tell you.

00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:44.260


00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.790
Learn from mistakes-- capable
of managing temper and anger,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.440
able to distinguish
wants and needs,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.820
handles pressure
so on and so forth,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.940
down to engage in
diverse yet consensual

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.947
sexual relationships.

00:03:57.947 --> 00:03:59.530
Some characteristics
that we generally

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.090
don't consider important
in adult life--

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.380
respond to a timer on
a five minute interval,

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.960
naming all 50 states.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.645
Sorting 500 colored
beads, demonstrating

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:14.530
unearned compliance
to authority.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.380
We teach kids to be compliant
to every adult figure we

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.462
put in that classroom.

00:04:19.462 --> 00:04:21.920
And I have to tell you that's
one of the most unsafe things

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.890
we do.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.350
Because I have failed
almost every time

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.630
I've tried to teach adolescents
with classic autism,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.130
low verbal guys, not
to go with strangers.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.610
Because we've taught them
to always go with strangers.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.850
That's what they
got reinforced for.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.200
Completing worksheets during
downtime-- answering correctly,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.100
how old are you and
when is your birthday?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.040
If they are asking you,
they don't know the answer.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.926
So you can say
anything you want.

00:04:49.926 --> 00:04:51.175
You don't have to be truthful.

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:53.790


00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.690
Respond to a greetings only
if presented in the same way--

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.350
identifying the
stages of the moon.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.470
We have to put that in our
IEPs for science goals.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.840
Reading 500 sight words--

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.330
I have kids who when I first
started to work with them

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.820
could identify the word
poison, but would still

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.795
drink the poison.

00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:13.900


00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.090
That's the value of sight words.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.560
You need to have sight meaning
to go with your sight words--

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.500
even going to factoring
binomial equation,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.010
identifying weights
and measures.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.830
So we're focusing on
skills that may not be

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.470
all that useful in adult life.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.056
And then into that fray
steps the behavior analyst.

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.930
And when you move from
the educational system

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.200
into the adult system or
you start doing transition,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.740
one thing you need to
now is you really don't

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.850
get to be a specialist anymore.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.180
You work with little
kids, you can be the BCBA.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.530
You can be the speech
and language pathologist.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.160
You can be the special
education teacher.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.880
You work with older guys, you
need a good working knowledge

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.330
of ABA, education law, labor
law, mental health concerns,

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.030
medication side effects,
sexuality, menstrual care--

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.070
I know more about menstrual care
than any adult male should--

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.119
job development, job coaching,
community-based instruction,

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:19.660
generalized systems
of communication,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.118
staff training,
community training.

00:06:21.118 --> 00:06:24.260
And that's just a start.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.260
I don't get to say I'm
really good at teaching

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.840
joint attention.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.790
Because I have to look
at the entirety of what

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.390
your existence is going to be
and all those multiple systems

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.640
that will impact
how you're going

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.770
to be able to express
all of these skills

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:41.120
that I'm trying to teach you.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.870
But you know what?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.790
Thankfully, behavior analysis is
probably one of the few fields

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.070
that, actually, we
have the resources

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.750
to be able to do this.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.550
Stepping outside the
little autism box

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.020
and going into
behavioral economics

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.030
and organizational
behavior management

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.950
and all of these
other areas, we have

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.850
significant clinical
resources to draw on

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.775
to address all of
these other areas.

00:07:05.775 --> 00:07:08.510


00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.580
But within our own field,
much of the skill acquisition

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.490
research with little kids
can be generalized to adults.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.780
So we can go back, and
we can generalize stuff.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.540
But some of it can't.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.300
For example, we all
know that chaining

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.720
is a pretty effective way
to teach complex sequences

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.520
of behavior, right?

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.089
You all agree with me?

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:35.630
Good Because it's
Tom Zane's article.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.671
So you better believe me.

00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:40.020


00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.380
Now, here's a pretty
straightforward, if somewhat

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.980
overly wordy, task
analysis for zippering.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.740


00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.810
Every jacket with a zipper,
every sweater with a zipper,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.550
every piece of
clothing with a zipper,

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.820
can be zipped using
this task analysis.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.420
It doesn't change.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.460
The task analysis
for grocery shopping,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.770
however, changes every time
you go to the grocery store.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.270
First of all, it's
no longer linear.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.271
It has three
different components.

00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.770
There's production skills, which
are sort of the basic motor

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.440
skills that you need
to complete the task.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.757
There's social
skills, which you need

00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:23.340
to navigate that
environment, and then

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.570
basic navigation skills.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.102
How do you get around that
supermarket in the first place?

00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:31.060
And in each one of those
steps, the variability

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.674
may be very low.

00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:34.090
If you go to the
same supermarket,

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.964
the baskets are in the
same place every time.

00:08:35.964 --> 00:08:38.169
So there's low variability.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.460
But the social skills
you might need,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.550
they're going to vary
from time to time.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.850
And that's why it's so difficult
to teach some of this stuff

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.880
in a way that actually promotes
independence and competence

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.630
in the community.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.860
Well then what would be
considered an essential skill?

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.570
I don't know.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.060
It changes depending on
where the individual lives,

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.920
what their goals are,
all of these things.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.130
I don't know how
to ride a horse.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:10.729
I was talking to Dr. Zane.

00:09:10.729 --> 00:09:12.520
Like, I'm a renter for
the rest of my life,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.510
because I don't know anything
about fixing a house.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.570
I'm glad other people
do, but I don't.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.000
So what actually is
an essential skill?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.875
Well, this is the draft
that I'm working on.

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:29.920
It starts with any skill that
targets a basic need in health,

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.670
safety, hygiene, and mobility.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.040
I'm fascinated when
I go to classrooms

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.611
that are in big schools.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.860
They have, you know, the
resource room that, the kids,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.347
they go to specials.

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:44.680
But none of the kids are ever
taught to sort of navigate

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.530
that whole school safely.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.440
When you have this amazingly
safe huge environment

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.274
to teach this one particular--
you don't take advantage of it.

00:09:54.274 --> 00:09:56.440
Any skill that, when acquired,
enables an individual

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.350
to independently complete
a variety of relevant tasks

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.790
and engage in
desired activities,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.580
this would be more into
that behavioral cusp area.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.860
Any skill that's used
with sufficient frequency

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.410
to stay in the
individual's repertoire--

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.720
exception to this
would be social skills,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.740
would be safety skills.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:14.810
Because safety
skills, hopefully,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.980
are low-frequency use skills.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.080
And then lastly, any
skill that can be acquired

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.500
within a reasonable time frame.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.840
One of the things
I want to point out

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.650
is in the education
system, you have

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.220
talented, trained,
resourceful behavior analysts.

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.570
You have talented,
dedicated professionals,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.640
special education people.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.700
If you work with speech
and language and OTs, cool.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.960
You have parents that are
dedicated and involved.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.150
You are this great law called
IDEA that funds all this stuff.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.897
But you don't have time.

00:10:55.897 --> 00:10:56.730
You don't have time.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.900
And that clock starts
ticking around the age of 12.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.950
And if you have a 6
hour classroom day,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.142
instructional time is actually
probably 4 and 1/2 hours.

00:11:07.142 --> 00:11:08.600
And then multiply
that across time,

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.750
and try and hit those IEP goals.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.450
Good luck.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.040
So we need to get
better at targeting

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.130
what really are the important
skills based upon this.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.800
Now, these are from an IEP
that I reviewed, I guess,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.260
two years ago for
a 19-year-old kid

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.170
and using some of the
criteria I put forth.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.010
When is your birthday?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.590
Well, how often do you use that?

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.930
It's less frequent than
once every other month.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.170
You know the last time somebody
asked me when my birthday is?

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.880
When I started
dating my girlfriend.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.504
Like, that was it.

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:45.170
And how important is
the correct answer?

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.150
With her, it's important,
but nobody else.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.650
I could tell any
one of you, and you

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.460
wouldn't know the difference.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.170
So who cares?

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.440
Where do you live?

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.140
If I asked any one of
you where do you live,

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.100
you would tell me the
state or the city.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.850
You would not tell me
your street address.

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.500
Ask any kid on the
spectrum where they live,

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.910
they will tell 15 Harrentown
Road, Princeton, New Jersey.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.000
Like, that's not
the right answer.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.840
What's your address?

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.566
You may want to give that.

00:12:16.566 --> 00:12:18.440
But the right answer is
just street and city.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.660
Wiping after a bowel movement?

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.610
At least once a day you do that.

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:27.410
Less frequent-- I mean,
it's really important.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.970
But the fact is,
why do you get to 19

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.872
and still needs help there?

00:12:30.872 --> 00:12:32.330
I can't tell you
the number of kids

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:37.220
I meet who are 17, 18, 19,
50, who they were never

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.360
actually taught this.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.470
Make a meal with a recipe?

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:41.220
Well, that's good.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.076
That's once a week.

00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:43.200
You would at least do that.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.010
There's some important.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.810
But if you look at response
effort, you know what?

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.226
There are a whole bunch of
really good microwaveable meals

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:49.140
now.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.656
Why don't we just like
jump over the recipe thing

00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:54.030
and teach this
other thing, so we

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.423
can teach them a diversity
of meals much easier?

00:12:58.423 --> 00:12:58.923

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160


00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:09.480
And it took me a total of three
images to get to a bikini.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.910
Then down here-- I put the
dots myself, by the way.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.070
These weren't on Bing images.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.350
Because obviously, I think
breasts are OK, but vagina,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.849
not.

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.000


00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.460
And if you see, they get
progressively more explicit

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.500
as you go down and
get closer together.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.620
Then I search for porn?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.360
Did I look for porn?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.000
No, but I found porn.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.500
But then, if you
don't know, there's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.160
something also called Rule
34, which, if it exists,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.780
it exists as internet porn I
don't care what that kid is

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.360
into, he can find it as porn.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.790
There's Simpson porn, Lego
porn, Family Guy porn,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.990
superhero porn, Thomas the
Tank porn, Barney porn--

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.590
you name it.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.790


00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.470
So now, back to our question.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.290
Now we have a population-based
norm reference

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.040
data indicating that that's
actually what most people do.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
Most people engaging
in sex-- most people

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.050
are going to see porn.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.280
So that's actually in the realm
of appropriate behavior, then.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.320
If the majority of people
do it, that's appropriate.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.670
So now, should your
client see porn?

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.360
What's your decision?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.910
And what do you base it on?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.310
And how do you come to that?

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.130
Is this a question of ethics
or a question of values?

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.020
None of these are
easy questions.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.980
The first case that I
worked on of an individual

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.540
with a sexually
challenging behavior

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.200
was, he had a fascination
with yellow vinyl.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.257
He would masturbate
on yellow vinyl.

00:01:58.257 --> 00:01:59.840
So there was yellow
vinyl in his room.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.506
He could masturbate
on the yellow vinyl.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:02.710
No problem.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.070
The reason I got called in is,
that year, yellow rain slickers

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.139
became very popular among women.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:12.619


00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.160
So then we were like, well, we
have to do something about it.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.414
But what do we do?

00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:17.330
This is what he wants.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000
And if we pair it
with, like, nude women,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.249
then we're objectifying women.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.950
And we're assuming that
he's actually straight.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.835
So what do we do?

00:02:25.835 --> 00:02:27.710
So we just make sure
that he knew his bedroom

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.330
with this vinyl.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.371
We got him lots of vinyl.

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.330
That's what we did.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.900
So that was the
answer to that one.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.440


00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.550
When approaching a
questionable situation,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.440
according to Cooper
Heron and Heward,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.330
behavior analysts rely
on three questions.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.620
What's the right thing to do?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.440
But that's really
a values question.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.210
That's not necessarily
an ethics question.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.050
And this is where we often get
bogged down in our discussion.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.120
What's worth doing?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.370
This also comes in as
sort of a values question,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.660
because it has to do with
your personal efforts.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.486
And then the outcome, if the
person acquires this skill--

00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:05.360
and where we get into
ethics, though, really,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.026
is, what does it mean
to be a good BCBA?

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:09.700


00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.460
Well, I think, like almost
everybody else today,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.300
we have to go back to these--
to the seven dimensions of ABA.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.270


00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.350
And while all seven
dimensions are essential,

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.962
independent of whichever
part of the field you're in,

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:26.670
the most difficult
ones, at least for me,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.340
seem to be the least discussed.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.240
These are applied-- deal with
problems of social importance--

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.830
effective-- producer strong
socially important effects--

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.640
and generality--
designed from the outset

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.070
to operate in new environments
after formal treatment

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.227
has ended.

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:44.310
So let's look at applied--

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.710
deals with problems
of social importance.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.769
Effective autism
intervention is certainly

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.060
a problem of social importance.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.180
So we're good here.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.940
Like, we've got
ourselves covered here.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.360
But if we drill down
a little, what aspect

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.010
of autism intervention
is particularly

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.885
of social importance?

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.180
Behavior reduction,
teaching reading, increase

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.330
in verbal behavior, development
of normative personal care

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.280
skills, recovery from
EIBI, compliant-- like,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.004
what's the part of it?

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.920
So I would therefore
suggest that the mere act

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.350
of providing autism intervention
is insufficient to fill

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.679
this dimension.

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:21.470
It has nothing to do
with the effectiveness

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.070
of our interventions.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.290
It's just, we have this
very broad-based approach.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.748
And we sort of sit
back and go, no,

00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:28.790
because we do good autism
intervention, that this

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.319
is of social importance.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.860
What about it is of
social importance

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.020
for this particular kid?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.142
Effective-- produce strong,
socially important effects.

00:04:39.142 --> 00:04:41.100
Well, you know, we're
really good at that, too.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.720
So I think we're pretty
good here, except--

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.600
well, since Lovaas in '87,
and the subsequent research

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.510
on EIBI, what can
we really point

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.490
to is a strong socially
important behavior

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.140
analytic research
discovery since then?

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.757
What's changed the
field since then?

00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.840
Now, this is not discounting
all the good research

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.580
that's been done,
whether it's functional

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.390
behavioral assessment, or
research on joint attention.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.970
There's a bunch
of good research.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.940
But that's the last
thing to dramatically

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.310
change our field, in
terms of strong, socially

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.880
important effects.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.790
And the problem here for me--

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.110
let's say we have two kids--

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.800
both five-year-old
kids-- typical autism--

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.620
both fairly identical-- no
such thing as typical autism.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.220
We know that.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.590
But just work with me here.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.830
One kid goes to a very
good private ABA-based

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.910
special education program
at a $100,000 a year.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.220
The other kid goes
to a public school

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.420
program that gives him
10 hours of ABA a week,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.380
but it costs $35,000 a year.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.760
They're both there
until graduation.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.984
So our kid in the ABA program,
it costs us $1.8 million.

00:06:02.984 --> 00:06:08.070
The kid in the public school
program costs us $600,000.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.280
If both of these kids go into
the same adult day program,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.390
have we really done anything?

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.520
I don't know.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.820
Yes, we've taught a
whole bunch of skills,

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.590
but none of the
skills that mattered,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.900
if we put them
collectively together,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.566
to bring them to a higher
level of adult competence.

00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:30.690
So I would suggest that
despite our many triumphs--

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.340
and there's far more
than any other field--

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.510
we need to start asking and
answer bigger and more socially

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.470
important questions.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.510


00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.090
And then lastly, as generality--

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.127


00:06:45.127 --> 00:06:47.210
in other words, generalization
and maintainance of

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.710
acquired skills should
be a direct result.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.120
We program for that.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.750
That's good.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.079
We do a lot of
work in this area.

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.620
The challenge here
is that we sort of

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.090
stopped researching
generalization and maintenance,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.590
though.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.950


00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.310
In 2006, there have only
been two articles published

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.810
in the peer review literature
with generalization and autism

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.070
in the title.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.960
Only five were in 2015,
while, between 1991 and 2014,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.580
there were 72.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.724
This is no longer a
real topic of interest.

00:07:17.724 --> 00:07:19.140
But you know, the
challenge really

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.410
isn't generalization
from classroom to home.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.830
The challenge is
generalization from classroom

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.980
to the community,
and then maintaining

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.320
after we, like, pull
away, so that this

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.002
is maintained by
natural contingencies,

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:33.710
if they do exist.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.920
And how do we actually develop
a self-management procedure

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.070
so that he can self-reinforce
in that environment

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.560
in order to help maintain
these skills that we taught him

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.050
in such a way to improve
the quality of his life?

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.304
I think, perhaps,
we're bothersome.

00:07:47.304 --> 00:07:48.470
I mean, we've all said this.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:48.950
I've said it.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:49.574
You've said it.

00:07:49.574 --> 00:07:50.540
I know it.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.880
It's that we often blame
the lack of generalization

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.551
maintenance on the kid.

00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:56.300
We say, well, you know,
people with autism

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.216
don't generalize well.

00:07:57.216 --> 00:07:58.880
Or we blame it on the parents.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.380
They didn't do it
at home, so that's

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.419
why it didn't generalize.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:04.460
If we identify a problem,
we can fix the problem.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:06.220
And you know, when
I first started

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.170
working in the
field back in '80,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.060
there wasn't a whole
lot of of approach

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.587
to vocal verbal behavior
with kids with autism.

00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:15.170
It was like, that's
not going to work.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:16.530
We can't do that.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.490
But look how many kids with
autism we've taught to speak

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.740
Just because it was part of
the neurological challenge

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.350
in the past-- we've
never let that deter us

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.540
from addressing this.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.480
So why has this become
sort of like that?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.280
So I do think that despite
a good understanding

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.590
of the basics, we need to,
again, ask bigger questions

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:37.830
about, how do we do this?

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.820


00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.820
Next to last, we do have
the behavioral analyst

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.007
ethical code.

00:08:49.007 --> 00:08:50.840
It was established by
the behavioral analyst

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.420
certification board.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.050
We all know it.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.980
You guys know it.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:56.290


00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.570
Clients have a right
to effective treatment.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.179
Behavioral analysts have a
responsibility to advocate.

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:04.720
In these instances with more
the one scientifically supported

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.780
treatment, behavioral
analysts review and appraise

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.056
the effects of treatments.

00:09:11.056 --> 00:09:13.180
Behavioral analysts are
responsible for all aspects

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.471
of a behavioral change program.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:17.720
Now, obviously,
there's much more.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720
But when I looked for,
is there any section

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.960
on socially important
outcome, the closest

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:27.160
we get is section 4.05
describing behavior change

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.601
program objectives.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.850
Behavioral analysts describe
in writing the objectives

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.766
of the behavioral change
program to the client

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:34.990
before attempting to
implement the program.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.450
To the extent possible,
a risk-benefit analysis

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.610
should be conducted
on the procedures

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.964
to be implemented to reach
the objective, the description

00:09:42.964 --> 00:09:45.130
of the program objectives,
and the means by which we

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.650
accomplish this ongoing process.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.110
So we really have
nothing about outcomes.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:58.080
We have nothing about,
what we do results in this.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.440
And I get bothered by that.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.950
Because you know, if
a surgeon performs

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.440
a beautiful, technically
proficient operation

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:09.060
to remove the right kidney,
but the left kidney should

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.624
have been removed,
would we still

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:13.665
consider they met their
ethical code of behavior?

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:17.057


00:10:17.057 --> 00:10:18.140
And I think, probably not.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:22.590


00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.240
So I think as a code of
ethics, any code of ethics

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.910
that focuses solely
on process aspects

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.970
is, perhaps, incomplete.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.590
So what I offer
as a suggestion is

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.510
that it's not time to
consider a revision,

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.080
but, perhaps, an addition.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.550
And my addition is
this-- section 11.0.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.580
Behavioral analysts focus
on socially important

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.389
and environmentally
valid outcomes.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:53.680
Behavioral analysts are
expected to develop, implement,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.442
supervise, and modify as
necessary behavior change

00:10:56.442 --> 00:10:58.900
programs that focus on socially
important and generalizable

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.017
outcomes.

00:11:00.017 --> 00:11:02.100
Pretty congruent with our
seven dimensions, right?

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.850


00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.671
11.1-- goal selection.

00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:10.170
Behavioral analysts are expected
to identify behavior change

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.750
goals that take into
account chronological age

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.570
of the client, his or her
preferences and deficits,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.560
the demands of current
and future environments,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.643
and that have the greatest
potential to generalize

00:11:19.643 --> 00:11:22.320
and maintain after intervention
is predicted by matching law.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.850


00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.134
11.2-- location of services.

00:11:29.134 --> 00:11:31.550
Behavioral analysts are expected
to recognize and minimize

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.190
the challenges to behavior
change programs that

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.009
are inherent in less
contrived environments,

00:11:37.009 --> 00:11:38.550
such as the client's
home, community,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.773
or place of employment.

00:11:39.773 --> 00:11:43.640


00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.572
11.3-- Mike Dorsey brought this
up before-- social validity.

00:11:48.572 --> 00:11:51.030
Behavioral analysts are expected
to develop behavior change

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.950
goals that are socially
valid, and to identify

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.740
potentially effective
interventions strategies that

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.210
are evidence-based
and acceptable

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.520
to the community at large.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.840
I live in New York
City, which is actually

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.660
the greatest place in the world
to work with kids with autism.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.700
Because my standard of
behavior for appropriate

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.540
behavior is enormous.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.030
My kids can't draw
attention to themselves.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:17.928


00:12:17.928 --> 00:12:19.830
It's also nice because
you get to actually do

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.600
repeated opportunities
without needing a van.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.600
So we had kids that would
come in in the morning

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.590
and go to the grocery
store, because it

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.840
was right on the corner,
and buy something.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.440
And then they'd go again in the
afternoon and buy something.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.070
So they could go three times
a day to the grocery store,

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.910
because we didn't need a van.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.320
We didn't have to travel.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.480
So you can get
repeated practice.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.630
But we did a little
social validity study

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.760
about all those
skills that, really,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.410
the other people in
the supermarket--

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.760
the other customers-- thought
were important for us to teach.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.160
And we had stereotypic behavior.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.100
We had all this other stuff
that we asked people about.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.210
Do you know what the most
important skill the majority

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.960
of New Yorkers targeted?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.280
That they swipe their
credit card quickly.

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.600
They didn't care about rocking.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.100
They didn't care
about noise-making.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.110
They didn't care about anything.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.690
New Yorkers understand autism.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.490
They understand diversity.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.030
But they don't
accept incompetence.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.900
And the one skill in that whole
chain that really holds them up

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.650
is when the cashier says, OK,
that will be 34.90, and then,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.650
he slowly takes out his
wallet, and slowly opens it,

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:38.497
because it's a frickin' Velcro
wallet with his name in magic

00:13:38.497 --> 00:13:40.830
marker on it, because that
actually helps you with HIPAA

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.240
laws.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.906
Let me tell you.

00:13:41.906 --> 00:13:45.770


00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:49.160
Now, you're pissing off
everybody behind you in line.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.380
Right?

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.304
So based upon their input,
we changed our task analysis.

00:13:54.304 --> 00:13:56.720
Because after you put all your
stuff on the conveyor belt,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.890
then you took out
your debit card,

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.040
so that you were ready,
when she said that's 30.48,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.160
to just go, boom, put
it back in your wallet,

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.637
and then we could go.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.970
Because we looked at what the
demands of the environment

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:13.140
were, as opposed to what
we thought were important.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.090
Because we were wrong.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.730
Because we live in a
kind of isolated bubble.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:20.230
So once we actually
started to ask,

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.271
we found out there were
a lot of different skills

00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:24.590
that we should be teaching.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:26.090
Staff training--
Behavioral analysts

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.048
are expected to provide
evidence-based training

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:31.270
to non-behavioral analytic staff
in less contrived environments

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.740
in a manner that best promotes
the correct implantation

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.400
of behavior change
programs for their clients.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.215
I put that in because I
think, despite all our support

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:43.590
for evidence-based
interventions,

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.930
staff training is one
area where we do the worst

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.480
job of evidence-based training.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.450
We do this.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.100
We do verbal
didactic instruction.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.720
We know that verbal
training results in what?

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.170
Verbal behavior.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.457
They don't go out and
then do this stuff.

00:15:01.457 --> 00:15:03.790
So at the EPIC School, we've
changed our entire training

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.450
program to be almost
entirely hands-on,

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.980
with pre-tests and post-tests.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.410
And we videotape people, and
they have to grade themselves

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.700
on this intervention.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.710
And we go back and forth,
so that they actually

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.940
become proficient at what
they're supposed to do.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.380
They might not know all the
terms for what they're doing.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.880
But they can do it really well.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.355
We'll teach them
the terms later.

00:15:25.355 --> 00:15:27.480
We wanted to be able to
implement this stuff first.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.070


00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.160
And then lastly, outcomes--

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.230
behavioral analysts are
expected to identify

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.110
evidence-based interventions
in such complex areas

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.200
of human competence as
independence, safety,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.170
self-management, communication,
time management, self-care,

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.260
employment, et cetera,
the acquisition of which

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.890
may be associated with more
positive overall outcomes

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.140
in adulthood.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.774
That's what we're supposed
to be doing, right?

00:15:55.774 --> 00:15:57.440
If you're working at
early intervention,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.856
you're supposed
to be looking down

00:15:58.856 --> 00:16:00.880
the road for this
particular kid.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:05.740
And how do we get them
to have a real life?

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.760


00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.040
So some closing thoughts.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.662


00:00:04.662 --> 00:00:06.120
If you've never
read this article--

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.703
I have it in almost
every presentation

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:10.440
I do-- you have to download
and read this article.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.670
Diane Bannerman, Jan
Sheldon, James Sherman,

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.840
and Alan Harchik,
balancing their right

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.240
to habilitation with the
right to personal liberties.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.010
The rights of people with
developmental disabilities

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.718
to eat too many
doughnuts and take a nap.

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:25.230


00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.420
I go into classrooms
all the time,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.777
and I see the kid sitting
there with his token board,

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:31.860
and sometimes there's a
little clearer plastic cup

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.944
on his token board, and
there's a Dorito in there.

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:35.735
And his teacher is
sitting there with a cup

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:36.820
of coffee and a doughnut.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.260


00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.330
I think there's a bit
of imbalance there.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.010


00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.770
At what point do we move
into this it's your choice,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.510
it's your life.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.180
How do I then support you?

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.460
It's no longer my decision.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.840
What do we do?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.030
And you know what?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.740
It's like, they'll make
bad choices, people say.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.820
But if he makes bad choices--

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.820
you know what, some of
the best times in my life

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.986
are when I made bad choices.

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:09.299


00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.340
And it's really true--
it's true for all of you--

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.214
the best stories you
have are the stories you

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:16.200
won't tell your mother, right?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.536
But we never give
people that opportunity.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:22.730


00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.040
Please remember that
ABA, in and of itself,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.120
is a three-term contingency.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.200
Yes, there's behavior and
yes, there's analysis,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.980
but it's that applied part.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.510
That for me is
the critical part.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.090
I often describe myself
as a behavior analyst

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.960
but with a capital
A, in applied.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.170
Because that's where
I put the emphasis.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.230
We need to be able to move this
stuff out into the community,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.340
into homes, into wherever
it needs to go, otherwise,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.210
we're not meeting
our obligation.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.600
But here's the challenge.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.660
How do we deal with risk?

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.410
Life is full of risk.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.970
But how do we teach
risk management

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.060
to kids with classic autism
and significant cognitive

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.639
challenges?

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.361
And how do we--

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.510
we so overprotect
kids on the spectrum

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.980
that we don't let them
make mistakes, do we?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.280
Instead of like-- in addition
to errorless learning,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.360
we do like errorless
life, is what we do.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.852
I was at an IEP meeting
for one of my students.

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:28.310
And his teacher wrote up, we
have to come up with a program

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.140
so he attends more
to his environment.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.350
Because he'll walk right into
that chair if you let them.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.290
And I said, let him.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.790
You know how he's going to learn
not to walk into the chair?

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.600
By walking into the chair.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.850
That's how every single
typical kid on the planet

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.199
learned to pay more attention.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:47.740
But for some reason,
we think we have

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.090
to develop a whole complex
behavior instruction

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.310
to teach him how to do that.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.630
Let alone, now he's 18,
let's say, or she's 18,

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.570
and you want me to
teach her sexual safety,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.770
and she doesn't even know
not to touch the hot stove.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.030
How do I teach the most complex
decision, safety risk avoidance

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.190
skill, when we've never
taught the basics?

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.920


00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.880
We need to start looking
at this if we're actually

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.209
going to be able to
teach kids the way

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.750
that they need--
the skills that they

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.000
need to have as they graduate.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.890


00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.847
Think big.

00:03:28.847 --> 00:03:31.180
We're really good at writing
behavior intervention goals

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.120
for really tiny
pieces of behavior.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.134
This is an actual goal
from one of our IEPs.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.550
John will be able to safely
navigate his work environment,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.190
allowing him to independently
use the restroom,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.940
take a break in the
staff room, and order,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.450
pay for lunch in the cafeteria.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.950
If he needs help
at any point, he'll

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.533
be able to seek out
a coworker and ask

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:50.360
for assistance using his ACS.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.360
Data will be collected
on independent initiation

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.193
of component skills,
and the number, type of

00:03:54.193 --> 00:03:56.152
prompts necessary to
complete the skill.

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.360
Social validity data will
be collected from coworkers

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.931
on a bi-weekly basis.

00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:03.430
10 years ago, if I was going
to write that goal it would be,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.346
John will safely navigate
his work environment

00:04:05.346 --> 00:04:07.390
by moving from the
bathroom to his workstation

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.684
independently, with no less
than three prompts, yada, yada.

00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:12.100
And then I would
say, John will be

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.990
able to take a
break in the staff--

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.810
we would write five, six,
seven different goals.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.455
But they don't exist
independently, do they?

00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:23.207
They exist as one
big behavior change--

00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:24.790
I almost said big
ass behavior change,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.900
that would have been bad--

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.736
one big behavior change.

00:04:28.736 --> 00:04:29.860
Thank god I didn't do that.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.480


00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.070
So here's my mission
statement, going forward.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.650
I think the mission
of autism education

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.534
is such that graduates
will exit the program,

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:45.950
not just employable,
but employed,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.290
a minimum of 20 hours a week.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.210
Here we have those
aspirational goals

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.050
that were talked about earlier.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.662
This has to be our target.

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:57.120
How do you plan if you don't
know what you're planning for?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.710


00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.350
You need to have a target.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.630
Not just with social skills,
but with a social support

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.440
network centered around where
they work, live, and recreate.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.470
We had two graduates this year.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.729
One that went into
the adult program.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.270
That's OK, it's a
good adult program,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.330
it was a good program for him.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.615
But the other graduated
into competitive employment.

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:22.240
And competitive employment-- it
was about 45 minutes from where

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.114
the school is, so we
had to drive a lot to do

00:05:24.114 --> 00:05:25.240
the training--

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.730
but you know what
else is 45 minutes

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.890
from where the school is?

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.866
Where he lives.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:33.490
So why should we try
and transition him

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.432
to a job that's 45 minutes
from where he lives,

00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:38.140
just because it's more
convenient for us?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.240


00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.210
What's really
fascinating is they--

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.920
voc rehab is now
supervising him.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.880
And his boss had to actually
tell the voc rehab person

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.380
to back off, because he said,
he knows what he's doing,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.100
you're being too
intrusive, just step back.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.292
And that's the kind of
supports that you want.

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:03.250
Not just with the ability
to follow directions,

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.387
but with the ability to
initiate actions on their own.

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:08.470
This, I think, is more of
a personal thing for me.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.100
I think in autism education
and behavior analysis,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.970
we've defined compliant
to the SD as mastery.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.100
So if I say, John
do your laundry,

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.340
and he does his laundry,
we say that's mastered.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.950
When actual mastery is
recognizing the laundry basket

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.450
is full, and then going
into your laundry.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.220
So we stop at that last part.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.670
So that's one of the big things
that we're looking at now.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.520
How do we develop these
environmental cues

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.970
that my guys can pick up on to
initiate to be on their own?

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.370


00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.730
And not just under
our stimulus control,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.480
but a stimulus control
of the environment,

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.840
and with the ability to
manage their own behavior.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.580
Starting around the
age of 12, everybody

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.150
starts being put on a
self-management program,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.816
because these are hard to teach.

00:07:03.816 --> 00:07:05.190
So we start around
the age of 12,

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.410
and then start building it up.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.780
Because I don't want
to have to be there.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.440
I'm getting too old to have
to do this stuff, you know,

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.770
so I want him to be as
independent as possible.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.110
And we've moved a lot of stuff.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.870
You know we have a couple
older guys who still like food

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.750
reinforcers, primaries.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.150
But how we do it is they
work for 45 minutes,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.720
and then they take a break, and
go get a snack on their own.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.430
Isn't that kind of
what you guys do?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.190
So there's no teacher
handing him a snack,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.110
there's no it's like--

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.964
go get it, man.

00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:40.130
And he has choice, and he
has all these other things

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.930
and he-- and you know, sometimes
he takes two bags of chips.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.530
Good for him.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.970


00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.760
He probably worked
extra hard that time.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.532


00:07:53.532 --> 00:07:55.740
And then my last thing is
that "failure is not always

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.406
a mistake, it may
simply be the best one

00:07:57.406 --> 00:07:59.790
can do under the circumstances."

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.440
The real mistake is
when we stop trying.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.040
Every day I wake up, and I
am faced by something that I

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.430
really don't know how to do.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.930
And I go into the literature,
and I talk to people,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.510
and I develop
instructional programs.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:20.885
But as was pointed out earlier,
I collect really good data.

00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:22.510
And then I make
changes really quickly,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.520
because I don't
have time to waste.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.780
And if something
doesn't work, I move on.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.400
And if something isn't of
value, we stop doing it

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.440
I was in my office
the other day,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.970
teacher came in
with a kid, stopped

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.669
and they said,
John where are we?

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.030
And he said, Peter's office.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.459
And he got a plus,
and they walked out.

00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:47.750
And I couldn't help but think
that that kid is actually

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.890
thinking, how fricking
stupid are you?

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.920
We've been in this
office 20 times now,

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.600
and you still don't
know where it is?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.530


00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:06.150
Once we get to a certain
point, it's time to move on.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.550
So what I want you
to do is think big.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.792
Because I think you guys--

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.540
and I mean this 100%--

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.720
are the last, best
chance for that kid

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.860
you work with to
have a real life.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.110
Nobody else is going to do it.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.401
Nobody else has the technology.

00:09:22.401 --> 00:09:23.790
Nobody else has the knowledge.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.750
It's you guys.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.860
And if we do our
jobs really well,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.569
then we've met all
seven dimensions.

00:09:32.569 --> 00:09:35.110
And we actually can go to bed
and sleep pretty well at night.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.020
So thank you all for
your kind attention.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.966
